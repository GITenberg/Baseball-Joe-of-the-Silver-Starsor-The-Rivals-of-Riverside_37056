<h3>A HOT GAME</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Come on, Sam, get a move on. I thought
you&rsquo;d be out on the diamond long ago. What&rsquo;s
the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I had to help dad put in some fence posts.
I&rsquo;m through now, Darrell, and I&rsquo;ll be right with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Setting fence posts; eh?&rdquo; and Darrell Blackney,
the young manager of the Silver Star baseball
nine of Riverside looked critically at Sam Morton,
the team&rsquo;s pitcher. &ldquo;Well, Sam, I hope it didn&rsquo;t
make you stiff so that you can&rsquo;t put some good
balls over the plate. It&rsquo;s going to be a hot game
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, forget it!&rdquo; cried Sam, as he finished
buttoning his jacket while he joined his chum.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll beat &rsquo;em to a frazzle all right. I&rsquo;m going
to pitch my head off to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
</p><p>&ldquo;You may&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t go to pieces the way
you once did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what you talking about?&rdquo; demanded
Sam, with some warmth. &ldquo;I can pitch all right,
and don&rsquo;t you forget it.&rdquo; He seemed unnecessarily
aroused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you can pitch,&rdquo; spoke Darrell
easily, &ldquo;only I don&rsquo;t want you to be too sure about
it. You know the Resolutes of Rocky Ford have
a strong team this season, and their pitcher
is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know what Hen Littell is as well as
you,&rdquo; broke in Sam. &ldquo;He thinks he&rsquo;s a whole lot,
but you wait. I&rsquo;ve got a new drop ball, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you&rsquo;d ought to have been out on
the diamond this morning, practicing with Bart
Ferguson. He&rsquo;s got a new catching glove, and if
you and he can connect on the curves we may do
some good work. But I wish you&rsquo;d had some
practice this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I, but dad made me help him, and I
couldn&rsquo;t very well get off. I tried to sneak away,
but he got on to my game and put a stop to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, of course if you had to help your
father that&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; spoke Darrell, who was a
manly young chap, somewhat in contrast to Sam,
who was not as upright as he might have been.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Sam had a boastful and confident air that caused
many to dislike him, but as he was the best pitcher
the Silver Stars had had in some seasons his short-comings
were overlooked.</p>

<p>And certainly Sam had been pitching pretty
good ball thus far. True, at times, he &ldquo;went up in
the air,&rdquo; but all pitchers are likely to do this on
occasions. Sam had great belief in his own ability.</p>

<p>There was considerable baseball feeling in the
little town of Riverside, located on the Appelby
River, in one of our New England States. Though
the nine was an amateur one, and composed of
lads ranging from fourteen to nineteen years of
age, yet many fast games had been seen on the
village diamond, which was kept in good shape by
volunteers. A small admission sum was charged
to view the contests and from this the boys were
able to buy their uniforms, balls, bats, and other
things. With some of the money the grounds
were renovated from time to time, and the fences,
bleachers and grandstand kept in order.</p>

<p>There was a sort of informal county league
existing among several nines in the towns surrounding
Riverside, and perhaps the bitterest
rivals of the Silver Stars were the Resolutes of
Rocky Ford, a place about five miles farther up
the stream than Riverside. To-day one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
games in the series was to take place, and the
occasion, being Saturday, was a gala one in the
home town of the Silver Stars, on whose grounds
the contest was to take place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have a little time for practice before
the game begins,&rdquo; remarked Darrell as he
and Sam walked toward the diamond. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got about an hour yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the Resolutes here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They hadn&rsquo;t come when I passed the grounds
a little while ago on my way to see you. I couldn&rsquo;t
imagine what kept you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was all dad&rsquo;s fault. Hang it all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; broke in Darrell quickly.
&ldquo;Dads are all right as a rule.&rdquo; He had lost his
own father not long since, and his heart was still
sore. He could not bear to have any one speak
disrespectfully of parents. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll make
out all right,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure we will!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam, full of
confidence. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t have a look in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hurry up and get in some practice with
Bart,&rdquo; advised the manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to cover first to-day?&rdquo; inquired
Sam, as they hurried along the streets, which were
already beginning to fill with the crowds making
their way to the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I am for most of the time,&rdquo; answered
Darrell. &ldquo;George Rankin and I talked it over
and decided that would be a good way to lead off.
Later, if I find I&rsquo;m needed on the coaching line,
I&rsquo;ll let Tom Davis take my place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom isn&rsquo;t much good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he miss two hot throws to first base in
the game last Saturday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was because you put them over his head.
You want to be careful, Sam, when there are two
on the bags, how you throw to first. Lots of times
I have to jump for your throws, and if I wasn&rsquo;t
pretty quick at it they&rsquo;d get by me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you won&rsquo;t have any complaint to-day.
I&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em there all right. But you&rsquo;d better
stay in the whole game yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see. Hark, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The inspiring notes of a coaching horn echoed
down the village street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a tally-ho,&rdquo; remarked Sam.</p>

<p>Just then there swung into view a large stage,
drawn by four horses, the vehicle filled with a
cheering, shouting and laughing crowd of boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Resolute team,&rdquo; said Darrell.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming in style all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again there came the thrilling notes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
bugle, blown by some one in the stage. Then followed
another large vehicle, filled with a throng
of cheering lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve brought a crowd along,&rdquo; commented
Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, maybe they&rsquo;re depending on rooters to
help them win the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, our fellows can root some too,&rdquo; spoke
the pitcher. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s going to be a big
crowd. I can pitch better then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do your best,&rdquo; urged the manager.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Percy Parnell and Fred Newton over
there. I thought they were out on the field long
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they had to set fence posts too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; assented Darrell with a laugh.
&ldquo;And here comes Tom Davis. Who&rsquo;s that with
him?&rdquo; and the pitcher and manager glanced at a
tall, well-formed lad who was walking beside the
substitute first baseman. &ldquo;Evidently a stranger
in town,&rdquo; went on Darrell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen him before,&rdquo; remarked Sam.
&ldquo;He lives down on our street. The family just
moved in. His name is Batson, or Hatson, or
something like that. His father works in the
harvester factory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; mused Darrell. &ldquo;He looks like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
decent sort of chap,&rdquo; and he gazed critically at
the stranger. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;d like to join our club,&rdquo;
for the ball team was a sort of adjunct to a boys&rsquo;
athletic organization.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve got enough fellows in now,&rdquo; said
Sam quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always room for one more,&rdquo; commented the
manager, who was ever on the lookout for good
material for the nine. Perhaps Sam suspected
something like this, for he glanced quickly at his
companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, if you think I&rsquo;m not good enough&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
began the pitcher, who was noted for his quick
temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, now, drop that kind of talk,&rdquo; said Darrell
soothingly. &ldquo;You know we&rsquo;re all satisfied
with your pitching. Don&rsquo;t get on your ear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t then,&rdquo; and Sam smiled frankly.</p>

<p>By this time Percy Parnell, the second baseman,
and Fred Newton, the plucky little shortstop, had
joined the pitcher and the manager, and greetings
were exchanged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we going to wallop &rsquo;em?&rdquo; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; assented Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a hot game all right,&rdquo; was
Percy&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the better,&rdquo; commented Darrell. &ldquo;Say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the people are turning out in great shape, though.
I&rsquo;m glad to see it. We need a little money in our
treasury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They turned in at the players&rsquo; gate. The Resolute
team had preceded them, and already several
of the members of that nine were in their uniforms
and out on the diamond. They were lads
of the same age as their rivals, and had about the
same sort of an organization&mdash;strictly amateur,
but with desires to do as nearly as possible as the
college and professional teams did.</p>

<p>But there was a great difference, of course, and
mainly in the rather free-and-easy manner in
which the rules were interpreted. While it is true
that in the fundamentals they played baseball according
to the general regulations, there were
many points on which they were at variance, and a
professional probably would have found much at
which to laugh and be in despair. But what did
it matter as long as the boys, and those who
watched them, enjoyed it? Not a bit, in my
opinion.</p>

<p>As the Silver Star lads proceeded to the improvised
dressing rooms under the grandstand, several
more of the Resolute players hurried out, buttoning
jackets as they ran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll get you fellows to-day all right!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
shouted Henry (otherwise known as Hen) Littell,
pitcher and captain of the Resolutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, the game&rsquo;s yours&mdash;if you can take
it,&rdquo; called back Darrell, with a laugh.</p>

<p>The diamond soon presented an animated scene,
with many players and a few substitutes pitching,
catching or batting balls about. The crowds were
beginning to arrive and occupy seats in the small
grandstand or on the bleachers. Many preferred
to stand along the first and third base lines, or seat
themselves on the grass.</p>

<p>Approaching the grounds about this time were
the two lads of whom Sam and Darrell had spoken
briefly. One was Tom Davis, the substitute first
baseman and the other boy whom Sam had referred
to as &ldquo;Batson&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hatson.&rdquo; Sam had
it nearly right. The lad was Joe Matson, and as
he is to figure largely in this story I will take just
a moment to introduce him to you.</p>

<p>Joe was the son of Mr. and Mrs. John Matson,
and had lately moved to Riverside with his parents
and his sister Clara, who was a year his junior.
The family had come from the town of Bentville,
about a hundred miles away. Mr. Matson had
been employed in a machine works there, and had
invented several useful appliances.</p>

<p>Located in Riverside was the Royal Harvester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Works, a large concern. In some manner Mr.
Isaac Benjamin, the manager, had heard of the
appliances Mr. Matson had perfected, and, being
in need of a capable machinist, he had made
Mr. Matson an offer to come to Riverside. It
had been accepted, and the family had moved in
shortly before this story opens.</p>

<p>Joe was a tall, well-built lad, with dark hair and
brown eyes, and a way of walking and swinging
his arms that showed he had some athletic training.
He had made the acquaintance of Tom
Davis, who lived in the house back of him, and
Tom had asked Joe to go to the game that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For it&rsquo;s going to be a good one,&rdquo; said Tom
proudly, since he was a member of the nine, even
though only a substitute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to win?&rdquo; asked Joe, as they approached
the grounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will, if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then Tom stopped suddenly,
for there was a yell from inside the fence
and a moment later a ball came sailing over it,
straight toward the two lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; yelled Tom. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hot one!
Duck, Joe, duck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Joe did not dodge. Instead, he spread his
legs well apart and stood ready to catch the swiftly-moving
horsehide in his bare hands.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>TIEING THE SCORE</h3>


<p>Ping! The ball came in between Joe&rsquo;s palms
with a vicious thud, but there it stuck, and a
moment later the newcomer had tossed it back
over the fence with certain and strong aim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess some one will pick it up,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; assented Tom. &ldquo;Say, that was a good
stop all right. Have you played ball before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a little,&rdquo; was the modest and rather
quiet answer. In fact Joe Matson was rather a
quiet youth, too quiet, his mother sometimes said,
but his father used to smile and remark:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let Joe alone. He&rsquo;ll make out all right,
and some of these days he may surprise us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that was a pippy stop all right,&rdquo; was
Tom&rsquo;s admiring, if slangy, compliment. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go in, I may get a chance to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe turned toward the main entrance gate, and
thrust one hand into his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo; demanded Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the grounds of course. I want to get a
ticket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; exclaimed his companion.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to pay. Come with me. I invited
you to this game, and I&rsquo;m a member of the
team, though I don&rsquo;t often get a chance to play.
Members are allowed to bring in one guest free.
I&rsquo;ll take you in. We&rsquo;ll use the players&rsquo; gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Joe briefly, as he followed his
new friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a good place to see it from&mdash;almost
as good as the grandstand,&rdquo; said Tom, as they
moved to a spot along the first base line.
&ldquo;Though you can go up and sit down if you like.
I&rsquo;m going to put on my things. I may get a chance
at first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll stay here,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Then I can
see you make some good stops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can if Sam doesn&rsquo;t put &rsquo;em away over my
head,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s so. You started to say that
you thought our side&mdash;you see I&rsquo;m already a
Silver Star rooter&mdash;that our side would win, if
something didn&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and then that ball came over the
fence. Well, we&rsquo;ll win, I think, if Sam doesn&rsquo;t go
to pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Sam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam Morton, our pitcher. He&rsquo;s pretty good
too, when he doesn&rsquo;t get rattled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll hope that he doesn&rsquo;t to-day,&rdquo;
said Joe with a smile. &ldquo;But go ahead and dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented Tom, and he started off
on a run to the dressing rooms. It was only just
in time, too, for at that moment Darrell came
hastening up to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you got your suit on?&rdquo; the manager
asked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll probably play some innings
anyhow, and I don&rsquo;t want any delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;right away,&rdquo; Tom assured him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you think will win?&rdquo; asked a youth
sitting next to Joe on the grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; began Joe slowly. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t seen either team play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you&rsquo;re a stranger here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, just moved in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you with Tom Davis. You must be that
Matson lad he told me lived back of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, and I hope Tom&rsquo;s side wins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff! So do I. But those Resolutes
have a good nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, go on!&rdquo; broke in a lad back of Joe.
&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t any good batters at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Hank Armstrong?&rdquo;
demanded some one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s pretty good, but Ford Lantry or
Seth Potter on our team can bat all around
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about their pitcher?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s pretty good,&rdquo; admitted the lad who
had first addressed Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t come up to Sam Morton when
Sam is at his best,&rdquo; said some one else, joining in
the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;<i>when</i> he&rsquo;s at his best,&rdquo; repeated another
lad. &ldquo;Those Resolutes have it in for us,
but we&rsquo;re going to wipe up the ground with them
to-day all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like fun!&rdquo; exploded a Resolute sympathizer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; broke in the voice of the umpire,
and the clanging of the gong warned the players
and others to clear the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re last at the bat,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;and that
means a whole lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Joe, and then the Silver Star
pitcher took his place in the box and exchanged a
few preliminary balls with the catcher, Bart Ferguson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; yelled the young umpire again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
selecting some pebbles with which to keep score.</p>

<p>Hank Armstrong, the sturdy left fielder of the
Resolutes, was the first at the bat for his side, and
with a vicious swing he hit the first ball which
Sam pitched to him. Squarely on the bat he
caught it with a resounding ping!</p>

<p>Away it sailed straight over Sam&rsquo;s head and
over the head of the second baseman. Farther
and farther it went, until the centre fielder began
running back to get it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wow! Pretty one! Pretty one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on! Go on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make a three bagger of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, you beggar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These and many other cries speeded Armstrong
on. He was running fast and reached second well
in advance of the ball. But he dared not go on to
third.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum, if they hit Sam like that too often he
won&rsquo;t last very long,&rdquo; commented Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was a fluke,&rdquo; declared Rodney
Burke, who sat behind Joe.</p>

<p>There was a surprised and disconcerted look
on Sam&rsquo;s face as he gazed at the next batter. No
sooner had the ball left Sam&rsquo;s hand, that Armstrong
was away for third like a shot, for he was
a notorious base stealer. Bart threw to third, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the ball went too high and the baseman jumped
for it in vain. Armstrong came in with the first
run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begins to look bad!&rdquo; yelled Tom in Joe&rsquo;s ear,
for the cheers and exultant yells of the Resolute
crowd made ordinary talking impossible.</p>

<p>But that was all the visiting team got that inning,
for Sam struck out two men, and the third
fouled to Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see what our fellows can do,&rdquo; commented
Tom.</p>

<p>Seth Potter, the left fielder, was first up, and he
had two strikes and three balls called on him in
short order. Then he got under a pretty one and
made first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch out now, and run down when he
throws!&rdquo; cried Darrell, who was coaching.</p>

<p>Seth did run, but was caught at second. Jed
McGraw, the centre fielder, was next up and
knocked a safety, getting to first.</p>

<p>Then came Ford Lantry, who played right field,
and he knocked a pretty three-bagger which
brought in McGraw and the run. At that the
Silver Star crowd went wild with joy, but it was
all they had to crow over as the next two men
struck out and Lantry died on third.</p>

<p>The next two innings were marked by goose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
eggs for both sides, and in the fourth inning the
Silver Stars brought in two runs, while their opponents
could not seem to connect with the
ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Sam is doing fine!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he seems to have good control,&rdquo; commented
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he lacks speed,&rdquo; said Rodney Burke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, cheese it! Do you want to give all our
secrets away to these fellows?&rdquo; asked Tom in a
low voice, indicating the many Resolute sympathizers
who were all about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; murmured Rodney, and Joe
felt a sudden wild hope come into his heart.</p>

<p>The game went on enthusiastically, if not correctly
from a professional or college baseball
standpoint. Many errors were made and several
rules were unconsciously violated. The young
umpire&rsquo;s decisions might have been questioned
several times, and on numerous occasions the game
was stopped while the respective captains, and
some of the players, argued among themselves, or
with the umpire. But the disputes were finally
settled, though there was a growing spirit of dissatisfaction
on both sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; yelled the umpire, at the conclusion
of an argument in the fifth inning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>It was then that the Resolutes did some heavy
stick work, and tallied three runs to the enthusiastic
delight of the team and its supporters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do better than this,&rdquo; murmured
Darrell to Captain Rankin and Sam when they
took the field at the end of that inning, and a big
circle stared at them from the score board as the
result of their efforts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing all I can!&rdquo; snapped Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not getting decent support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, cut it out! Of course you are!&rdquo; asserted
Rankin.</p>

<p>A single tally by each side in the sixth, and two
for the Silver Stars and one for the Resolutes in
the seventh, brought the game to that usual breathing
spot. The score was now a tie, and the excitement
was growing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For cats&rsquo; sake beat &rsquo;em out, fellows!&rdquo; pleaded
Darrell. &ldquo;Use your bats. They&rsquo;re to hit the
ball with, not to fan the air!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps his frantic appeal had some effect, for
in the next inning the Resolutes only got one run,
while, when the Silver Stars came to bat to close
the inning, they hammered out three, putting them
well ahead.</p>

<p>But there was trouble brewing. Sam&rsquo;s arm was
giving out. He realized it himself but he dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
not speak of it. Grimly he fought against it, but
he saw that the other side was aware of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on now, we&rsquo;ll get his goat!&rdquo; yelled the
captain of the Resolutes. Then began what may
be regarded as the cruel practice of yelling discouraging
remarks at the man in the box. Sam
was plainly told that he was &ldquo;rotten&rdquo; while other
and less mild epithets were hurled at him.</p>

<p>These had their effect. He gave two men their
base on balls, and he made a number of wild
throws to first where Tom Davis had replaced
Darrell Blackney. However, by a strong brace
Sam managed to hold his opponents runless,
though in this saving work he was nobly assisted
by his fellows, and by the quickness of Tom in not
letting the wild balls get by him. Tom was a magnificent
high jumper, which served him in good
stead.</p>

<p>The ending of the eighth saw the score nine to
seven in favor of the Silver Stars, they having
brought in three runs.</p>

<p>It began to look, in spite of Sam&rsquo;s trouble, as if
the home team would win. There was a riot of
cheers when the Resolutes went to bat in the
ninth inning, and despite the fact that they were
two runs behind, their supporters did not fail
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Win! Win! Win!&rdquo; they yelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll win all right,&rdquo; said Captain Littell
grimly.</p>

<p>And he and his men gave good evidence of doing
so a few minutes later. Sam literally &ldquo;went
to pieces.&rdquo; He lost all control of the ball, and
was fairly &ldquo;knocked out of the box.&rdquo; There was
a look of despair on the faces of his mates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo; demanded
Joe, who was surprised at the sudden slump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s what he does every once in a
while,&rdquo; said a disgusted Silver Star supporter.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t depend on him. Wow, that&rsquo;s rotten!&rdquo;
for Sam had delivered a ball that was batted over
the right-field fence.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a wild scene. Two men
were on second and third base respectively when
this &ldquo;homer&rdquo; was knocked and they came racing
in. The home-run batter followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ring around the rosey!&rdquo; yelled the Resolute
captain. &ldquo;If we had more on base they&rsquo;d all
come in. Hit at anything, fellows! Hit everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It looked as if they were doing it, for they made
six runs that inning, which brought the score to
thirteen to nine in favor of the visitors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five runs to win, and four to tie,&rdquo; murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Darrell as his men came in from the field for their
inning. &ldquo;Can we do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>How it was done even he scarcely knew, for so
fierce was the rivalry between the teams, and so
high the excitement, that several times open
clashes were narrowly averted. But the four
runs were secured, and though the Silver Stars
played their best they could not get another one.
But even to tie the score after Sam&rsquo;s slump was
something worth while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten innings! It gives us another chance for
our white alley,&rdquo; murmured Tom to Joe, as the
first baseman made ready to go on the sack again.
&ldquo;If we can get one run, and hold them down to a
goose egg it will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Resolutes seemed to have struck a winning
streak. Sam could not pull himself together,
and got worse. Darrell was in despair, and there
was gloom in the hearts of the Riverside residents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t they another pitcher they can put
in?&rdquo; asked Joe of one of his neighbors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and if they had Sam would raise such a
row that it might bust up the team. He&rsquo;ll play it
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the tenth inning the Resolutes pounded out
three more runs, batting Sam all over the field, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
when the Silver Stars came up the score was sixteen
to thirteen against them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for a bunch of runs!&rdquo; pleaded Darrell,
as his men went to bat.</p>

<p>But they couldn&rsquo;t get them. The Resolute
pitcher with a grin on his freckled face sent in
curve after curve and struck out two men in short
order. Then Tom Davis knocked a little pop fly
which was easily caught, and the game ended in a
riot of yells, as a goose egg went up in the tenth
frame for the Silver Stars. They had lost by a
score of sixteen to thirteen, and there were bitter
feelings in their hearts against their rivals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get a pitcher who can pitch?&rdquo;
demanded one of the Resolutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you insult me!&rdquo; cried Sam striding forward.
&ldquo;I can pitch as good as your man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, listen to him! He&rsquo;s dreaming!&rdquo; some
one yelled, laughingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am; eh? Well, I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo; cried Sam
angrily, and the next instant, in spite of the effort
of Darrell to hold him back, he had leaped for the
lad who had mocked him, and had struck him a
heavy blow.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>MRS. MATSON IS WORRIED</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; demanded the
lad whom Sam had struck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean by it. I mean you can&rsquo;t
insult me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, eh? Well, I can whip you all right,&rdquo;
and with those words Sam was nearly knocked off
his feet by a return blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, cut that out!&rdquo; yelled Darrell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s eating you?&rdquo; demanded another
of the Resolute crowd. &ldquo;If you fellows are looking
for a fight you can have it; eh boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; came in a chorus, as the players
crowded up, with bats in their hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This may be serious,&rdquo; murmured Darrell to
Tom. &ldquo;See if you can&rsquo;t stop Sam from fighting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was too late, as Sam and his opponent
were at each other hammer and tongs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to fight?&rdquo; sneered the lad who
had accosted the manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come on,&rdquo; and the lad, half in fun perhaps,
gave Darrell a shove.</p>

<p>Now Darrell, though disliking fistic encounters,
was no coward and he promptly retaliated with a
blow that knocked his enemy down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! It&rsquo;s a fight all right!&rdquo; yelled another
lad, and then Darrell and his antagonist were at it.</p>

<p>The crowd from the stands and bleachers now
began thronging about the enraged players. There
had always been more or less bad blood between
the two rival nines and now, when the Resolutes
had taken a game that was almost won away from
the Silver Stars, the feeling broke out anew.</p>

<p>On all sides there were impromptu battles going
on. Some of the lads were good-natured about it,
and only indulged in wrestling contests, but others
were striking viciously at each other and soon
there were some bloody noses and blackened eyes
in evidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you whether I can pitch or not!&rdquo;
yelled Sam, as he aimed a hard blow at the lad
with whom he had first had an encounter. He
missed his aim, and went whirling to one side, to
be met by a blow as he turned about, and almost
sent down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want anything?&rdquo; suddenly demanded
a lad stopping in front of Joe, who was standing
near Tom. Joe recognized his questioner as the
Resolute shortstop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s a stranger here&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t on the
nine,&rdquo; said Tom quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, can&rsquo;t he fight?&rdquo; was the sneering demand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if I want to, but I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; and
Joe answered for himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you want to,&rdquo; was the retort, and
Joe was struck in the chest. He was not a lad to
stand for that and he retaliated with such good
effect that his opponent went down in a heap on
the grass, and did not arise for some seconds.
When he did stagger up, and saw Joe calmly waiting
for him, the lad moved off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can fight all right,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Darrell had disposed of his lad, and
Tom, who was engaged with a small lad who
made a sneering remark, grabbed hold of the
chap and shook him until the lad begged for
mercy.</p>

<p>Sam and his opponent were still at it hot and
heavy when there arose a cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheese it&mdash;here come the cops!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>Riverside boasted of a small police force, and
while it was not very formidable, most of the lads
came from homes where a report of their arrest
for fighting would meet with severe punishment.
Their ardor suddenly cooled and, almost as soon
as it had started, the impromptu battle was over.
The victorious nine gathered up their belongings
and moved off the diamond, jeering at their defeated
rivals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was their fault&mdash;they started the fights,&rdquo;
declared Tom Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess it was,&rdquo; admitted Darrell.
&ldquo;Well come on, fellows. They beat us, and
though I think it wasn&rsquo;t exactly square on some of
the decisions, we can take our medicine. We&rsquo;ll do
better next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean me?&rdquo; demanded Sam half
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;all of us,&rdquo; spoke Darrell slowly,
&ldquo;including myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some excitement; eh?&rdquo; asked Tom, as he
linked his arm in that of Joe Matson and walked
along with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it was a good game just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You play, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to, at Bentville, where we moved
from,&rdquo; answered Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a good team?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mostly at pitching. I like that better
than anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; mused Tom. &ldquo;It takes a pretty
good one to pitch these days. It isn&rsquo;t like it used
to be. Pitching is a gift, like poetry I guess. You
can&rsquo;t go in and pitch right off the reel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; answered Joe quietly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
my one ambition. I want to go to a good boarding
school and get on the team as pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you do,&rdquo; and Tom laughed
frankly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that myself, though
I don&rsquo;t know as I care so much for pitching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best part of the game!&rdquo; cried Joe,
and his eyes shone and he seemed to lose some of
his usual quiet manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it above everything
else!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got any curves?&rdquo; asked the practical Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know as I have&mdash;yet. I&rsquo;m
practicing though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got any speed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They used to say I had, back there in Bentville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum! Well, I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s much
chance for you here. Sam has the Silver Stars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
cinched. But he was rotten the last half of to-day&rsquo;s
game. That&rsquo;s what made us lose it. Yes,
it takes some pumpkins to pitch now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys walked on down the street after Tom
had discarded his suit. Before them and behind
them were other players and spectators, talking
of nothing but the game and the fight that had followed.
The Resolutes, cheering and singing triumphantly,
had departed in their big stages, and in
the hearts of the Silver Stars was gloom and despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, come over and see me sometime,&rdquo; invited
Tom, as he parted from Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will. You come over and see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys went their respective ways&mdash;Joe walking
rather slowly and thinking of what had just
taken place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I would like to pitch&mdash;and go to boarding
school!&rdquo; he mused as he walked toward his
house. As he entered the side door he saw his
mother sitting at the dining room table. Something
about her attracted his attention&mdash;aroused
his fears. The cloth had been spread, and
though it was supper time, for the game had lasted
until late, there were no dishes on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why mother!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, struck by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
queer look on her face. &ldquo;What is the matter?
Has anything happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Joe!&rdquo; she exclaimed starting up, as
though she had not heard him come in. &ldquo;Oh, no,
nothing is the matter,&rdquo; she went on, and she tried
to smile, but it was only an attempt. &ldquo;I forgot it
was so late. Your father was home, but he went
out again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He said he had some business
to attend to. But I must hurry with the supper.
Where were you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the ball game. There was a fight. Our
side lost. Oh, how I wish I had been pitching! If
ever I go to that boarding school I&rsquo;m going to try
for the nine, first thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you&rsquo;re always talking about a boarding
school, Joe. Well, I&mdash;I hope you can
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;m sure something has happened!&rdquo;
exclaimed Joe, putting his arms around her and
patting her on the shoulder, for she was a little
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, really,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a
little worried, that&rsquo;s all. Now you can help me set
the table if you will. Clara has gone to take her
music lesson and isn&rsquo;t back yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. &ldquo;But
what are you worried about, mother? I wish
you&rsquo;d tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t now, Joe. Perhaps I will some time.
It isn&rsquo;t anything serious&mdash;yet,&rdquo; and with that Mrs.
Matson hurried out of the room.</p>

<p>She smiled as she left her son, but when she
reached the kitchen the same serious look came
over her face again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope what he fears doesn&rsquo;t come to pass,&rdquo;
she remarked to herself. &ldquo;Poor Joe! it would
be too bad if he couldn&rsquo;t go to a boarding school
when his heart is so set on it. And to become a
pitcher! I wish he had some higher ambition in
life, though I suppose all boys are alike at his
age,&rdquo; and she sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; mused Joe as he went about setting
the table, for the Matsons kept no girl and Joe
and his sister often helped their mother with the
housework when their school duties permitted.
&ldquo;Something is worrying mother,&rdquo; the lad went on.
&ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t anything about father&rsquo;s business
in the harvester works. He took a risk when he
gave up his position in Bentville and took a new
one here. But that was an exciting game all
right,&rdquo; and Joe smiled at the recollection as he
went on putting the plates around at their places.</p>

<h3>A ROW WITH SAM</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was his sister Clara who asked the question,
and she had noticed that her brother was rather
dreaming over his books than studying. It was
the Monday night after the Saturday when the
memorable game with the Resolutes had taken
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing much,&rdquo; and Joe roused himself
from a reverie and began to pour over his books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, for &lsquo;nothing much&rsquo; I should say that
it was a pretty deep subject,&rdquo; went on Clara with
a laugh, as she finished doing her examples. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t one of the girls here, is it Joe? There are a
lot of pretty ones in our class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;bother!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. &ldquo;Let a fellow
alone, can&rsquo;t you, when he&rsquo;s studying? We
have some pretty stiff work I tell you!&rdquo; and he
ruffled up his hair, as if that would make his lessons
come easier. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a heap worse than it was
back in Bentville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so too, but I like it, Joe. We have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
real nice teacher, and I&rsquo;ve met a lot of pleasant
girls. Do you know any of the boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hu! I guess you want me to give you an
introduction to them!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more than you do to the girls I know,&rdquo; retorted
his sister, &ldquo;so there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, now,&rdquo; gently remonstrated Mrs. Matson,
looking up from her sewing, &ldquo;you young
folks keep on with your lessons. Your father
can&rsquo;t go on reading his paper if you dispute so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Involuntarily Joe and his sister glanced to
where Mr. Matson sat in his easy chair. But he
did not seem to be reading, though he held the
paper up in front of him. Joe fancied he saw a
look of worriment on his father&rsquo;s face, and he
wondered if he was vexed over some problem in
inventive work, or whether he was troubled over
business matters concerning his new position.</p>

<p>Then there came to the lad&rsquo;s mind a memory
of his mother&rsquo;s anxiety the night he had come in
from the game, and he wondered if the two had
any connection. But he knew it would not do to
ask, for his father seldom talked over business
matters at home.</p>

<p>Finally, seeming to feel Joe&rsquo;s look, Mr. Matson,
after a quick glance at his son, began to scan
the paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on with your studying, Joe and Clara,&rdquo;
commanded Mrs. Matson with a smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
dispute any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was only asking Joe if he knew any nice
boys,&rdquo; spoke Clara in vindication. &ldquo;I know how
fond he was of playing baseball back in Bentville,
and I was wondering if he was going to play
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I haven&rsquo;t much chance,&rdquo; murmured Joe
half gloomily, as he drew idle circles on the back
blank leaf of his book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Clara quickly. &ldquo;The girls
say the boys have a good nine here, even if they
were beaten last Saturday. There&rsquo;s going to be
another game this Saturday, and Helen Rutherford
is going to take me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there&rsquo;s a good enough team here,&rdquo;
admitted Joe. &ldquo;In fact the Silver Stars are all
right, but every position is filled. I <i>would</i> like to
play&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to pitch. I want to get all the practice
I can on these small teams, so when I go to
boarding school I&rsquo;ll have something to talk about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re still set on going to boarding
school?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Matson, sighing gently as
she looked at her son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly am&mdash;if it can be managed,&rdquo; replied
Joe quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Matson started so suddenly that the paper
rattled loudly, and his wife asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, John, did something in the
news startle you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;no,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I&rsquo;m
a bit nervous. I&rsquo;ve been working rather hard lately
on an improvement in a corn reaper and binder.
It doesn&rsquo;t seem to come just right. I believe I&rsquo;ll
go to bed. I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; and with &ldquo;good-nights&rdquo;
that were not as cheerful as usual he left the room.
Mrs. Matson sighed but said nothing, and Joe
wondered more than ever if any trouble was brewing.
He hoped not. As for Clara she was again
bent over her lessons.</p>

<p>The Silver Star nine was variously made up. A
number of lads worked in different town industries,
one even being employed in the harvester
works where Mr. Matson was employed. Others
attended school.</p>

<p>Joe Matson had attended the academy in the
town of Bentville whence they moved to Riverside,
and on arriving in the latter place had at once
sought admission to the high school. He was
given a brief examination, and placed in the junior
class, though in some of the studies the pupils there
were a little ahead of him, consequently he had to
do some hard studying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>The ambition to attend a boarding school had
been in Joe&rsquo;s mind for a long while, and as his
father was in moderate circumstances, and soon
hoped to make considerable from his patents, Joe
reasoned that his parents could then afford to send
him.</p>

<p>Among others on the nine who attended the
high school were Darrell Blackney and Sam Morton,
who were in the senior class, and Tom Davis,
whose acquaintance Joe had made soon after coming
to Riverside. There was a school nine, but it
was made up of the smaller boys and Joe had no
desire to join this. In fact none of the lads who
were on the Silver Stars belonged to the school
team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m through, thank goodness!&rdquo; finally
exclaimed Clara, as she closed her books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am too,&rdquo; added Joe, a moment later.
&ldquo;Hope I don&rsquo;t flunk to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to the game Saturday?&rdquo; asked
Clara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess so. Wish I was going <i>in</i> it, but
that&rsquo;s too much to hope for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know any one on the nine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tom Davis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the boy back of us, isn&rsquo;t he? His sister
Mabel is in my class.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Joe, &ldquo;but Tom is only a substitute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you could be that at first, and then get
a regular place,&rdquo; suggested Clara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; murmured Joe. He didn&rsquo;t have a very
high opinion of girls&rsquo; knowledge of baseball, even
his sister&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>When Joe reached home from school the following
afternoon he saw his mother standing on
the front steps with a letter in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Joe!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I was just waiting
for you. Your father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there anything the matter with father?&rdquo;
the lad gasped, his thoughts going with a rush to
one or two little scenes that had alarmed him
lately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nothing at all,&rdquo; answered his mother with
a smile. &ldquo;But he just hurried home from the
factory with this note and he wanted you, as soon
as you came home, to take it to Moorville. It&rsquo;s
for a Mr. Rufus Holdney there. The address is
on it, and I guess you can find him all right.
You&rsquo;re to wait for an answer. Go on your wheel.
It&rsquo;s only a few miles to Moorville, and a straight
road, so your father says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where it is,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;Tom
Davis has relatives there. He pointed out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
road to me one day. I&rsquo;ll go right away. Here,
catch hold of my books, mother, and I&rsquo;ll get my
wheel out of the barn,&rdquo; for a barn went with the
house Mr. Matson had rented.</p>

<p>A little later the lad was speeding down the
country road that pleasant spring afternoon. Joe
was a good rider and was using considerable
strength on the pedals when suddenly, as he turned
a sharp curve, he saw coming toward him another
cyclist. He had barely time to note that it was
Sam Morton, the pitcher of the Silver Stars, and
to utter a warning shout when he crashed full into
the other lad.</p>

<p>In a moment there was a mix-up of wheels, legs
and arms, while a cloud of dust momentarily hid
everything from sight. At first Joe did not know
whether or not he was hurt, or whether Sam was
injured. Fortunately Joe had instinctively put on
the brake with all his strength, and he supposed
the other lad had done likewise.</p>

<p>Then, as the dust cleared away, and Joe began
to pull his arms and legs out of the tangle, and
arise, he saw that Sam was doing the same thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re not hurt much!&rdquo; was Joe&rsquo;s first
greeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! It isn&rsquo;t your fault if I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; was
the ungracious answer, as Sam felt of his pitching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
arm. &ldquo;What do you mean by crashing into a fellow
that way for, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to. I didn&rsquo;t know that curve
was so sharp. I&rsquo;d never ridden on this road before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you blow your horn or ring
your bell or&mdash;or something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; demanded Joe with equal
right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Don&rsquo;t give me any of your
talk. You&rsquo;re one of the fresh juniors at school,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fresh,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Joe
quietly, &ldquo;but I am a junior. I&rsquo;m sorry if I hurt
you, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes you could, if you knew anything about
riding a wheel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Joe spoke a bit
sharply. &ldquo;I was into you before I knew it. And
besides, you ran into me as much as I did into
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not. If you don&rsquo;t know enough to ride
a wheel, keep off the roads!&rdquo; snarled the pitcher.
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m stiff for Saturday&rsquo;s game it will be your
fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be stiff,&rdquo; spoke Joe, and he
said it sincerely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And if my wheel is broken you&rsquo;ll have to pay
for it,&rdquo; went on Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Joe firmly.
&ldquo;It was as much your fault as mine, and my wheel
may be broken too. I&rsquo;m going to look,&rdquo; he added
as he lifted his bicycle from where it was entangled
with Sam&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>A bent pedal, which would not interfere with its
use, was all the damage Joe&rsquo;s wheel had sustained
and beyond a few bent spokes and a punctured
tire Sam&rsquo;s seemed to have suffered no great
harm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you straighten those spokes,&rdquo; said
Joe cheerfully. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take but a minute. I
can have my father straighten my pedal at the factory.
And I&rsquo;ll help you mend and pump up your
tire. I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; burst out Sam in a rage, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want any of your help. You&rsquo;re too fresh.
You come banging into a fellow, knocking him all
over and then you think you can square things by
offering to help him. I don&rsquo;t want any of your
help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; replied Joe quietly. &ldquo;Then
I&rsquo;ll be going on. I&rsquo;ve got an errand to do. But
I&rsquo;d like to help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind your own business!&rdquo; snapped Sam, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
rubbing his pitching arm. He made no motion to
pick up his wheel.</p>

<p>Joe was half minded to make an angry retort
but he thought better of it. He wheeled his bicycle
to the hard side-path of the road, and, ascertaining
that his letter was safe, prepared to mount
and ride away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mind you, if my arm is stiff, and I can&rsquo;t
pitch Saturday it will be your fault, and I&rsquo;ll tell the
fellows so,&rdquo; called Sam as he leaned over to pick
up his wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, only you know it isn&rsquo;t so,&rdquo; replied
Joe quietly.</p>

<p>As he pedaled on he looked back and saw Sam
straightening some of the bent spokes. The
pitcher scowled at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; mused Joe as he speeded up. &ldquo;Not a
very good beginning for getting on the nine&mdash;a
run-in with the pitcher. Well, I guess I wouldn&rsquo;t
be in it anyhow. I guess they think I&rsquo;m not in
their class. But I will be&mdash;some day!&rdquo; and with
a grim tightening of his lips Joe Matson rode on.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>JOE HELPS THE MANAGER</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well now, I&rsquo;m real sorry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Holdney
when, a little later, Joe dismounted at her
door, and held out the letter for her husband.
&ldquo;Rufus isn&rsquo;t home. You can leave the letter for
him, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have to have an answer,&rdquo; replied Joe.
&ldquo;I think perhaps I&rsquo;d better wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe you had, though I don&rsquo;t know
when Rufus will be back. Is it anything of importance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it must be,&rdquo; spoke the lad, for, though
he did not know the contents of his father&rsquo;s letter,
he reasoned that it would be on no unimportant
errand that he would be sent to Moorville.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; mused Mrs. Holdney. &ldquo;Well, if you
want to wait all right, though as I said I don&rsquo;t
know when my husband will be back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know where he&rsquo;s gone? Could I go
after him?&rdquo; asked Joe eagerly. He was anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to deliver the letter, get an answer, and return
home before dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I never thought of that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Holdney. &ldquo;Of course you might
do that. Rufus has gone down town, and most
likely you&rsquo;ll find him in the hardware store of
Mr. Jackson. He said he had some business to
transact with him, and he&rsquo;ll likely be there for
some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll ride down there on my wheel. I
guess I can find the place. Is it on the main
street?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, turn off this road when you get to the
big granite horse-drinking trough and swing in
to your right. Then turn to your left when you
get to the post-office and that&rsquo;s Main Street. Mr.
Jackson&rsquo;s store is about a block in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lad repeated the woman&rsquo;s directions over
in his mind as he rode along, and he had no difficulty
in picking out the hardware store. He was
wondering how he would know Mr. Holdney, but
concluded that one of the clerks could point him
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Holdney is here,&rdquo; said a man behind
the counter to whom Joe applied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in
the office with Mr. Jackson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I could send a letter in to him,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
ventured the lad, for he did not want to wait any
longer than he had to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; answered the clerk. &ldquo;Mr.
Jackson is very strict about being disturbed when
he&rsquo;s talking business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I guess I&rsquo;ll have to wait,&rdquo; said Joe with
a sigh. &ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;ll be in there long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to say for sure,&rdquo; spoke the
clerk, leaning over the counter in a confidential
manner and speaking in a whisper. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
even dare to guess,&rdquo; he went on with a look toward
the private office whence came the murmur of
voices, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll venture to state that it will be
some time. Mr. Jackson never does anything in
a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Holdney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s just the opposite. He&rsquo;s as quick
as a steel trap. Too quick, that&rsquo;s the trouble.
He and Mr. Jackson are good friends, but when
Mr. Holdney springs something sudden on my
boss, why Mr. Jackson is slower than ever, thinking
it over. I guess you&rsquo;ll have to wait some time.
Is there anything you&rsquo;d like to buy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think not,&rdquo; said Joe with a smile, and
then he sat down on one of the stools near the
counter while the clerk went off to wait on a customer.
The lad was getting impatient after nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
an hour had passed and there was no sign of Mr.
Holdney coming out. The murmur of voices continued
to come from the private office&mdash;one voice
quick and snappy, and the other slow and drawling&mdash;an
indication of the character of the two men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish they&rsquo;d hurry!&rdquo; thought Joe. He began
to pace back and forth the length of the store,
and he was just thinking he would have to ride
home in the darkness, and was wondering whether
there was oil in his bicycle lamp, when the door of
the private office opened and two men came out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe to himself.
The men were still talking, but Joe concluded that
their business was about over so he chanced going
up to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have a letter for
Mr. Holdney. It&rsquo;s from my father, Mr. Matson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, what&rsquo;s&mdash;that&mdash;son?&rdquo; asked the older of
the two men, in drawling tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for me. I&rsquo;m Mr. Holdney!&rdquo; exclaimed
the other quickly. &ldquo;From Mr. Matson, eh?
Well tell him I can&rsquo;t help him any more. I haven&rsquo;t
any spare&mdash;but wait a minute, I&rsquo;ll write my answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;you&mdash;better&mdash;read&mdash;the&mdash;letter&mdash;first,&rdquo;
mildly and slowly suggested Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I know what it is all right!&rdquo; exclaimed
the other quickly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll read it. Let&rsquo;s
have it!&rdquo; He almost snapped it from the lad&rsquo;s
hand and Joe wondered what could be the business
relations between his father and this man.</p>

<p>With a flourish and a quick motion Mr. Holdney
tore open the envelope and read the letter almost
at a glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Just as I expected.
No, I&rsquo;m done with that business. I can&rsquo;t do any
more. You may tell your father&mdash;hold on,
though, I&rsquo;ll write it,&rdquo; and, whipping out a lead
pencil Mr. Holdney scribbled something on the
back of Mr. Matson&rsquo;s note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re John Matson&rsquo;s son; eh?&rdquo; he asked
of Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum! Go to school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Riverside High.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum! Ever invent anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; answered Joe with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;never do it. It&rsquo;s a poor business.
Play ball?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did in Bentville where we lived, but I haven&rsquo;t
had a chance here yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum! Yes, Bentville. That&rsquo;s where I met
your father. Here&rsquo;s the answer. There you are.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Now don&rsquo;t lose it,&rdquo; and quickly handing the communication
to Joe, Mr. Holdney turned and resumed
his talk with the hardware merchant.</p>

<p>Joe was a little dazed by the quickness of it all,
and there were many questions running through
his mind. Somehow the manner of Mr. Holdney&mdash;the
message he had started to ask Joe to deliver
by word of mouth, his apparent refusal of something
Mr. Matson had evidently asked him to do&mdash;all
made Joe vaguely uneasy. He connected it
with his father&rsquo;s nervousness the night before and
with his mother&rsquo;s anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no use worrying until I have to,&rdquo;
concluded Joe with a boy&rsquo;s philosophy as he left
the hardware store, and truth to tell, he was thinking
more of his chances of going to boarding
school in the fall perhaps, and whether or not he
would get an opportunity to play ball, than he was
of any possible trouble.</p>

<p>On leaving the hardware store Joe was surprised
to find it growing dusk. Gathering clouds
added to the gloom and he made up his mind that
the last part of his homeward journey would be
made in darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll see if I have any oil in the lamp,&rdquo;
he remarked as he was about to mount his wheel.
&ldquo;If I haven&rsquo;t I can get some here.&rdquo; But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
found, on shaking the lantern, that it was filled
enough to carry him to Riverside, and he was soon
pedaling along that country road.</p>

<p>The clouds continued to gather, and as the journey
back was partly up hill, and as the bent pedal
did not permit of fast riding, Joe soon found it
necessary to alight and set the lamp aglow.</p>

<p>He was riding on, looking carefully ahead of
him, to avoid stones and ruts that the gleam of
light revealed, when, as he came to rather a lonely
spot on the road, he heard, just ahead of him, a
commotion.</p>

<p>There was a sound of carriage wheels scraping
on the iron body guards, the tramping of a horse&rsquo;s
feet, and then a voice called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa now! Stand still, can&rsquo;t you, until I see
what&rsquo;s the matter? Whoa! Something&rsquo;s broken,
that&rsquo;s evident, worse luck! And I&rsquo;m two miles
from nowhere. Whoa, now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have I heard that voice before?&rdquo;
mused Joe as he rode more slowly so as not to
have another collision in the darkness.</p>

<p>He could hear some one jump to the ground and
then the restless horse quieted down under the
soothing words of the driver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s broken all right,&rdquo; the voice went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
&ldquo;And how in the mischief am I going to mend it?
Whoa, now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Joe rode up, and in the glow of his light
he saw Darrell Blackney, the manager of the Silver
Stars, who was standing beside a carriage one
side of the shafts of which hung down from the
axle. The bolt had evidently broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Joe, dismounting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; quickly asked Darrell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Joe Matson,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I know
you. I&rsquo;m in the junior high class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Matson, I think I heard Tom Davis
speak of you. Well, I&rsquo;ve had an accident. I was
out driving when all at once one side of the shafts
fell down. It&rsquo;s a bad break I&rsquo;m afraid; bolt
sheared off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder your horse didn&rsquo;t run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Prince is pretty steady; aren&rsquo;t you Prince
old fellow?&rdquo; and Darrell patted the animal&rsquo;s nose.
&ldquo;But what the mischief am I to do? It&rsquo;s too far
to go to the next town and leave Prince here, and
I can&rsquo;t ride him, for he isn&rsquo;t used to it and might
throw me off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; asked Joe. &ldquo;I might ride
to the nearest place and get a bolt, if you told me
what kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the places would be closed by this time I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
guess,&rdquo; was the rueful answer. &ldquo;Much obliged to
you just the same. I certainly am in a pickle!
Next time I go out driving I&rsquo;ll bring part of a
hardware store along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a bolt is it?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just an ordinary carriage one, flat headed.
Bring your light here, if you don&rsquo;t mind, and I&rsquo;ll
take a look at it. I could only tell it was broken
by feeling in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the glow of the bicycle lamp it could be seen
that the bolt had broken squarely in two in the
middle, and could not be used again. But at the
sight of it, as Darrell held the two parts in his
hand, Joe uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the manager of
the Silver Stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have the very thing!&rdquo; said Joe quickly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some spare bolts in my tool bag.
They may not be the same size, but they&rsquo;ll hold the
shaft in until you get home I think. I&rsquo;ll take a
look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; cried Darrell. &ldquo;Most anything
will do in a pinch. Even a piece of wire,
but I can&rsquo;t find any along the road in the dark. I
hope you have something,&rdquo; and while Joe opened
his tool bag Darrell patted the somewhat restive
horse.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>JOE HAS HOPES</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Yes, here&rsquo;s the very thing, I guess!&rdquo; said
Joe, after rummaging about in his leather tool case.
He produced a short but heavy bolt with a nut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly the same thing,&rdquo; remarked
Darrell, after looking at it carefully, &ldquo;but it will
do, if it&rsquo;s long enough. Would you mind holding
Prince&rsquo;s head while I try it? He might start up,
just as I got the shaft in place, and hurt my fingers,
if he didn&rsquo;t make me drop the bolt. Then we&rsquo;d
have a sweet time hunting for it in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe went to the animal&rsquo;s head and patted the
cold, velvety nose while the other lad lifted up the
dropped shaft and fitted it in place. He was
fumbling about in the flickering light of the bicycle
lantern which he had temporarily fastened to the
dashboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it do?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s just the cheese. Lucky I met you, or,
rather that you met me, or I don&rsquo;t know what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
would have done. The bolt is just long enough.
Now if I can get the nut on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wrench in my tool bag,&rdquo; interrupted
Joe. &ldquo;Shall I get it for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks, you stay by Prince. I can find
it. You haven&rsquo;t been in town long, have you?&rdquo;
asked Darrell, as he was working away over the
nut, which was a little tight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, about a week. I was at the Resolute ball
game though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were? It was a shame it broke up the
way it did, but I don&rsquo;t think it was our fault,
though Sam Morton is pretty quick tempered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe had good reason to know that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered from the darkness near the
horse&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;it was the fault of the Resolutes all
right. They ought to have been satisfied after
pulling the game out of the fire the way they did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say so! They never ought to have
won it, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have, only Sam sort of&mdash;well
they got his &lsquo;goat&rsquo; I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Joe, while Darrell went on
fumbling with the wrench and nut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you play at all?&rdquo; came the manager&rsquo;s voice
from the vicinity of the flickering light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; and Joe&rsquo;s tone was eager while his
heart was strangely beating. It was a chance he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
had never dared hope for, to have the manager of
the Silver Stars ask him that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; came the next inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Bentville, where I used to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh. Have a good team?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to pitch.&rdquo; There was a pause and then,
emboldened by what had happened, Joe went on.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s a vacancy in your nine, is
there?&rdquo; and he laughed half whimsically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, hardly, that is, not in the box,&rdquo; said Darrell
slowly. &ldquo;Sam has his faults, but he&rsquo;s the best
pitcher we&rsquo;ve had in a long time and I guess we&rsquo;ll
keep him. There, that&rsquo;s fixed,&rdquo; he went on, tapping
the bolt to see that it was firmly in place.
&ldquo;Now I can go on, I guess. I&rsquo;m a thousand times
obliged to you. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d have done
only for you. After this I&rsquo;m going to carry a light,
and some spare bolts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He handed Joe back the wrench and took the
lamp off the dashboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a bolt in place of this the next
time I see you,&rdquo; the manager went on, as he held
the lamp out to our hero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t necessary. I don&rsquo;t need it for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
wheel. It was just one of some odds and ends that
I carry with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darrell stood looking at Joe, whose face was
illuminated brightly by the full focus of the lamp.
The manager seemed struck by something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you look as if you
were built to play ball. Were you at it long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a couple of years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitch all that time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, only just the last few months of the
season. Our regular pitcher left and I filled in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. Hum, well, as I said we haven&rsquo;t any
vacancy in the box, but by Jove! come to think of
it I might give you a chance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s heart leaped wildly and he could hardly
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you, really?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not as a regular, of course&mdash;at least
that is not right off the bat. But if you&rsquo;d like to
try for place at centre field I believe I can manage
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s heart was a little despondent. Centre
field was not a very brilliant place in which to shine
with the Stars, but it was a start and he realized
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad of the chance,&rdquo; he managed to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll keep you in mind. You see our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
regular centre fielder, Jed McGraw, is going to
leave. His folks are moving out west and we&rsquo;ll
have to have some one in his place. I don&rsquo;t know
when he&rsquo;s going, but it&rsquo;s this week or next. I&rsquo;d
like to do something for you, to sort of pay you
for what you did for me to-night, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want anything for this!&rdquo; exclaimed
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t, but it just happened so. I
might not have known you except for this accident,
and as I said we will need some one to fill in at
centre field. Len Oswald is the regular substitute,
but he doesn&rsquo;t practice much, and he&rsquo;s got a job
over at Fordham so he can&rsquo;t always be sure of getting
off Saturday afternoons, which is when we
mostly play. So I&rsquo;ll put you down as sub now and
perhaps as regular&mdash;it depends on Len.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; Joe managed to say and he found
himself hoping that Len would have to work every
Saturday during the season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need some one with experience,&rdquo; went on
Darrell, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m glad I could give you the
chance. Tom Davis was saying you got mixed up
in the row the other day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I seem to be getting the habit,&rdquo; replied
Joe with a laugh. &ldquo;I had one with Sam Morton
on this road a little while ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! How did it happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe gave all the details.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum! Well, Sam sure has a quick temper,&rdquo;
went on the young manager. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s all right
soon after it,&rdquo; he added in extenuation. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
be friendly with you in a few days and forget all
about it. I wouldn&rsquo;t hold a grudge against him,
if I were you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shan&rsquo;t. It was both our faults.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be getting on,&rdquo; remarked Darrell,
after a pause. &ldquo;Come and see me sometime. I&rsquo;ll
see you at school to-morrow, and if there&rsquo;s anything
doing I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two boys&rsquo; hands met in a friendly clasp and
then the manager, getting into his carriage, drove
off. A little later, his heart filled with hope, Joe,
having put back his lantern and tool bag pedaled
toward home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was a lucky day for me, even if it did
look bad after that crash with Sam Morton,&rdquo; he
said to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to play ball, after
all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was rather a grave look on Mr. Matson&rsquo;s
face when Joe handed him the reply from
Mr. Holdney, and told of his interview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he can&rsquo;t help me&mdash;Oh, well, never mind,&rdquo;
and Mr. Matson turned aside and went into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
room where he kept a desk. Mrs. Matson followed,
closing the door after her, and for some
time the voices of the two could be heard in low
but earnest conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter; nothing wrong I hope?&rdquo;
asked Clara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess not,&rdquo; answered Joe, though he
was vaguely uneasy himself. Then came the
thought of his talk with the baseball manager and
his heart was light again.</p>

<p>Supper was rather a quiet affair that night, and
Mr. Matson spoke but little, quite in contrast to
his usual cheerful flow of conversation. Mrs.
Matson, too, seemed preoccupied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to get on the Stars!&rdquo; exclaimed
Joe, when he got a chance to tell of his
experiences that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Mr. Matson heartily.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no game like baseball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t fit a boy for anything,&rdquo; complained
Mrs. Matson. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t help in any of
the professions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a profession in itself!&rdquo; declared Joe
stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t intend to adopt it,&rdquo; spoke his
sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I might do worse. Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
at some of those big New York players getting
thousands of dollars a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But look how long it takes them to get to that
place,&rdquo; objected Clara, who liked to argue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;m young yet,&rdquo; laughed Joe.</p>

<p>In his room that night, while preparing for bed
Joe got to thinking of the possibility mentioned
by Darrell Blackney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to play my head off in centre field,&rdquo;
said Joe, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to practice batting, too.
Stick work counts. I&rsquo;m going to practice pitching,
also. Who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll get a chance in the
box if Sam ever slumps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! If I ever do!&rdquo; and standing before an
imaginary batter Joe flung out his arm as if delivering
a swift curve. With a crash his fist hit a
picture on the wall and brought it clattering down
to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; called Clara sharply from the
next room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was just practicing pitching,&rdquo; answered
Joe sheepishly, as he picked up the picture, the
glass of which had fortunately not broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better practice going to sleep,&rdquo;
responded his sister with a laugh.</p>

<p>Joe smiled. He had great hopes for the future.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>LAUGHED AT</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that in your pocket, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which pocket?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your coat. I declare, you&rsquo;ve got something
in both pockets,&rdquo; and Clara approached her
brother as if with the intention of making a personal
inspection of two big bulges on either side
of his coat. &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; she persisted, as
Joe backed away. Brother and sister had just gotten
up from the breakfast table, and were about to
start to school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe hastily, as
he looked for his cap. &ldquo;Got your lessons, Clara?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I have. But I&rsquo;m curious to know
what makes your pockets bulge out so. Don&rsquo;t you
know it will spoil your coat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; and Joe made another hasty
move to get out of reach of Clara&rsquo;s outstretched
hand. But he was not successful, and, with a laugh,
his sister caught hold of the bulging pocket on his
left side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A ball!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;A baseball upon my
word! Two of them! Oh, Joe, are you really
going to play on the nine Saturday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get a chance if Jed
McGraw leaves in time. But I&rsquo;m taking a couple
of old balls to practice throwing this afternoon
when I come from school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re starting in early,&rdquo; commented Clara.
&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t sleep with a baseball under your
pillow the way we girls do with pieces of wedding
cake,&rdquo; and she laughed merrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be willing to sleep with a ball and a bat
under my pillow if I thought I&rsquo;d get in the game
by it,&rdquo; admitted Joe frankly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not hoping
too much. Well, I&rsquo;m going. Good-bye momsey,&rdquo;
and he stopped to kiss his mother before he
hastened away to school. He looked at her closely
to discover whether there was any trace of worry,
but she smiled at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may not be home early,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going down to the fairgrounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; she asked quickly. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
a show there, is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I want to do a little baseball practicing,
and that place is well out of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baseball practice on the fairgrounds.
How&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>But she did not wait to finish her question for
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cake is burning in the oven. Good-bye,
Joe!&rdquo; and she ran to the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Sam Morton will say?&rdquo; Joe
reflected as he walked along. &ldquo;I certainly hope his
arm isn&rsquo;t lame, even if it was as much his fault as
mine. I don&rsquo;t want him to tell the fellows I&rsquo;m to
blame for him losing a game&mdash;if he should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fearing that the same thing might happen to
him as when Clara laughed at him for having the
two baseballs in his pockets, Joe slipped to his
desk as soon as he reached the school, and hid the
balls away back among his books. The balls were
two old ones he had used when on the Bentville
nine, and they were still in fair condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let the fellows get on to the
fact that I&rsquo;m practicing, until there&rsquo;s more of a
chance for me than there is now,&rdquo; thought our
hero, as he went out on the school grounds to
watch the lads at play.</p>

<p>An impromptu game was going on, but Joe did
not join. Darrell Blackney passed him, and in answer
to Joe&rsquo;s nod of greeting asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get home all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. How about you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine. The bolt was all right. I haven&rsquo;t forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ll see McGraw to-day and find out when
he&rsquo;s going to leave. Then if Oswald can&rsquo;t say for
sure whether he&rsquo;ll be with us, you&rsquo;ll go in at centre
field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, his eyes bright with
anticipation.</p>

<p>As Darrell passed on, Joe saw Sam Morton
approaching. At first he had a notion of turning
away and avoiding what he felt would be an unpleasant
scene. But Joe was nothing of a coward
and he realized that, sooner or later, he would
have to meet the pitcher with whom he had had
the collision. So he stood his ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your arm?&rdquo; he asked pleasantly, as
Sam approached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hu! None the better for what you did to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <i>I</i> did?&rdquo; and Joe&rsquo;s voice took on a surprised
tone. &ldquo;Do you still insist it was my fault?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty near,&rdquo; went on Sam, but Joe noticed
that he was not quite so vindictive as before. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t as stiff as I thought it would be, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you can pitch all right Saturday,&rdquo; went
on Joe. He wanted very much to hint at the fact
that he, too, might be in the game, but Sam was
not a lad to invite confidences, especially after
what had taken place. Joe liked comradeship. He
liked the company of boys of his own age and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was just &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; to talk baseball. But, aside
from Tom Davis, as yet he had no chums with
whom he could gossip about the great pastime.</p>

<p>In Bentville he was looked up to as one of the
nine, and, though the team was not as good a one
as was the Silver Stars, still it was a team, and
Joe was one of the principal players. Coming to
a strange town, and being distinctly out of the
game, made him feel like a &ldquo;cat in a strange garret,&rdquo;
as he said afterward.</p>

<p>But with a grim tightening of his lips he made
up his mind not to give way to gloomy thoughts,
and he determined that he would be on the town
team and one of the best players.</p>

<p>As the warning bell rang, Tom Davis came hurrying
across the school campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I called for you!&rdquo; he shouted to Joe who,
with a crowd of other lads, was going in the building,
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;d gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied Joe, grateful for the friendly
spirit shown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait next time.&rdquo; He liked
Tom, and was glad to have him for a chum.</p>

<p>Joe thought lessons would never be finished that
day, but the classes were finally dismissed and
then, without waiting for Tom, though he thought
this might be construed as rather unfriendly, our
hero hastened off in the direction of the fairgrounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
There was a high wooden fence around
this plot, and it gave Joe just the chance he wanted,
for he was going to practice pitching, and he didn&rsquo;t
want any witnesses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had half a dozen balls,&rdquo; he murmured
as he went in through one of the gates which was
unlocked. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have to chase back and
forth so often. But two will do for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laid his books down on the grass, took out
the horsehide spheres and, measuring a distance
from the fence about equal to the space from the
pitcher&rsquo;s box to home plate, he began to pitch the
balls.</p>

<p>With dull thuds the balls struck the fence, one
after the other, and fell to the ground. Joe picked
them up, took his place again in the imaginary
box, and repeated the performance.</p>

<p>His arm, that was a bit stiff at first, from lack
of practice since coming to Riverside, gradually
became limber. He knew that his speed, too, was
increasing. He could not judge of his curves, and,
truth to tell he did not have very good ones as yet,
for he had only recently learned the knack. But
he had the right ideas and a veteran professional
pitcher, who was a friend of one of the Bentville
nine&rsquo;s members, had showed Joe the proper manner
to hold and deliver the ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had some one back there to give me a
line on myself,&rdquo; thought Joe, as he pitched away,
a solitary figure on the grounds. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
whether I&rsquo;m getting them over the plate, or a mile
beyond,&rdquo; for he had laid down a flat stone to serve
as &ldquo;home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow this will improve my speed,&rdquo; he reasoned,
&ldquo;and speed is needed now-a-days as much
as curves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Time and again he pitched his two horsehides,
ran to pick them up as they dropped at the foot of
the fence, and then he raced back to his &ldquo;box&rdquo; to
repeat the performance. He was rather tiring of
it, and his arm was beginning to feel numb in spite
of his enthusiasm, when he heard some one laughing.
The sound came from behind him, and, turning
quickly, Joe saw Sam Morton standing leaning
up against his wheel, and contemplating him with
mirth showing on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam. &ldquo;This is pretty
good. What are you trying to do, Matson, knock
the fence down? If you are, why don&rsquo;t you take
a hammer or some stones instead of baseballs?
This is rich! Ha! Ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Joe was tempted to make an
angry answer, for the hot blood of shame mounted
to his cheeks. Then he said quietly, and with as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
much good-nature as he could summon on the spur
of the moment:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m practicing, that&rsquo;s all. I came here as I
didn&rsquo;t want to lose the balls, and the fence makes
a good backstop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Practicing, eh? What for?&rdquo; and once more
Sam laughed in an insulting manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To improve my pitching. There may be a
chance to get on the team, I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What team; the Silver Stars?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam&rsquo;s voice had a harsh note in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And Joe nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re practicing pitching, eh? And you
hope to get on our nine. Well let me tell you one
thing, Matson; you won&rsquo;t pitch on the Silver Stars
as long as I&rsquo;m on deck, and I intend to remain for
quite a while yet. Pitching practice, eh? Ho!
That&rsquo;s pretty good! What you&rsquo;d better practice
is running bases. We may let you run for some of
the fellows, if you&rsquo;re real good. Or how would
you like to carry the bats or be the water boy? I
understand there&rsquo;s a vacancy there. Pitcher! Ha!
Ha!&rdquo; and Sam doubled up in mirth. Joe&rsquo;s face
flushed, but he said nothing.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>A MEAN PROTEST</h3>


<p>Finally Sam ceased his laughter, straightened
up and prepared to ride out of the fairgrounds on
his wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just going past,&rdquo; he said, in needless explanation,
&ldquo;when I heard something banging
against the fence. First I thought it might be one
of the cattle left over from the last show, but
when I saw it was you, Matson&mdash;Oh, my! It&rsquo;s
too rich! I&rsquo;ll have to tell the boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, who disliked as
much as any one being laughed at, &ldquo;what have you
got against me, anyhow? Are you afraid I&rsquo;ll displace
you as pitcher?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Not much. You couldn&rsquo;t do
that you know,&rdquo; and Sam laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what do you want to be so mean for?&rdquo;
asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your business, if you want to know,&rdquo;
snapped Sam. &ldquo;But if you think you&rsquo;re going to
get on our team you&rsquo;ve got another think coming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Look out, now, don&rsquo;t break the fence with those
balls, or the fair committee might make you pay
for it,&rdquo; and with this parting insult Sam rode out
of the grounds.</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s heart was beating fast, and he clenched his
hands. He would liked to have gone after Sam
and given him a well deserved thrashing, but he
knew that would never do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got to grin and bear it!&rdquo; murmured
Joe through his clenched teeth. &ldquo;If the fellows
laugh at me I&rsquo;ll have to let &rsquo;em laugh. After all I
can stand it, and I <i>do</i> want to get on the team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queer why Sam Morton should be so down
on me. I don&rsquo;t see his reason unless it&rsquo;s jealousy,
or because he&rsquo;s mad at me for running into him.
Maybe it&rsquo;s both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no use practicing any longer. My
arm is tired, and besides he might be hiding behind
the fence to laugh some more. I&rsquo;ll have to find a
different place if I want to practice getting up my
speed and curves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Picking up the balls and his books Joe slowly
made his way out of the grounds. Sam Morton
was nowhere in sight, for which the young ball
player was glad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe this will end it,&rdquo; thought Joe. &ldquo;He
just wanted to amuse himself at my expense.&rdquo; But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
our hero was soon to find that the vindictive spirit
of the pitcher was not quelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming out to see us practice this afternoon?&rdquo;
asked Tom Davis of Joe several days
later. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting ready to play the Red
Stockings of Rutherford, Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;Will it be a
good game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ought to. The Red Stockings used to have
a good nine but they struck a slump and lately
we&rsquo;ve been beating them. But I hear they have a
new pitcher and they may make it hard for us.
Say, what&rsquo;s this yarn Sam is telling about you
practicing down on the fairgrounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; answered Joe with a
flush. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d get up some speed. I&rsquo;ve got
a chance to get on the nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so; I hadn&rsquo;t heard it. Gee! I hope
you do. How you going to manage it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know as Darrell wants it
known,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; and
Joe proceeded to relate his talk with the manager,
about the prospective leaving of McGraw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Jed is going away,&rdquo; admitted Tom.
&ldquo;I had forgotten about that. Say, I hope he
leaves before Saturday and then you can get a
chance to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Len Oswald, the substitute centre
fielder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Len is practically out of it. He can&rsquo;t get
off Saturday afternoons any more. Too much
business in that Fordham grocery where he works.
That&rsquo;s a good thing for you. I&rsquo;m real glad of it,
Joe. But say, if you want to practice pitching, why
didn&rsquo;t you ask me to catch for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to bother you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, get out. I&rsquo;d be glad to do it. Next time
you want to try it tip me off and we&rsquo;ll go some
place where Sam can&rsquo;t bother us. He&rsquo;s a mean
chap sometimes. I don&rsquo;t like him, but some of the
fellows think he&rsquo;s all there. He sure can pitch, and
I guess that&rsquo;s why we keep him. But come on, let&rsquo;s
go to practice. There may be a scrub game and
you can get in on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe and Tom found quite a crowd assembled on
the Riverside diamond when they arrived. The
nine and the substitutes were in uniforms, and Darrell
Blackney and George Rankin were talking to
the team, giving them some points about the coming
game with the Red Stockings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve got enough for a scrub game,&rdquo;
announced the captain, as Joe and Tom strolled
up. &ldquo;Tom, you play first on the scrub. And let&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
see&mdash;what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; and he turned to Joe,
who introduced himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend of mine,&rdquo; added Tom, &ldquo;so
treat him right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain. &ldquo;Well, he
can play on the scrub if he wants to. Out in the
field,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s Matson, whom I was telling
you about,&rdquo; put in the manager, and then he added
something in a low voice which Joe could not
catch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called the umpire, and the impromptu
contest was underway. Joe narrowly
watched Sam&rsquo;s pitching and even though he regarded
the lad as unfriendly to him, our hero
could not but admit that his rival in the box was
doing good work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I think I can equal him if I have a
chance,&rdquo; thought Joe, and he was not given to idle
boasting, either. &ldquo;Oh, if I only get the chance!&rdquo;
he exclaimed in a whisper.</p>

<p>Then a high fly came his way and he had to get
down to business and stop his day-dreaming. He
ran back to get under the ball, and made a pretty
one-handed catch. There was some applause from
the little group of spectators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good eye!&rdquo; yelled Tom Davis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried some one else, and
Joe felt a warm thrill of pleasure as he threw the
ball in.</p>

<p>Of course the first team won, for the scrub was
composed of odds and ends, with some substitutes
from the Silver Stars, but Joe had done his best to
hold down the score.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good work, Matson,&rdquo; complimented Darrell,
when the contest was over. &ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;ve
about decided in your case. You can get ready to
play centre field Saturday. McGraw can&rsquo;t be with
us, and we can&rsquo;t count on Oswald. Have you a
uniform?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A uniform; what for?&rdquo; asked Sam Morton
quickly. He had come up behind Joe and Darrell,
and had heard the last part of the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot to tell you fellows that Matson
is our new member of the team,&rdquo; went on the manager.
&ldquo;Shake hands with him, boys. I&rsquo;ve been
watching him play to-day and I think with a little
practice he&rsquo;ll make good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he going to play?&rdquo; demanded Sam
roughly, while the lads crowded around Joe, congratulating
him, asking him questions as to where
he had played ball before, and shaking hands with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
him. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he going to play?&rdquo; and Sam
pointed what seemed like an accusing finger at
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Centre field&mdash;McGraw&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; answered the
manager briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Regular or substitute?&rdquo; demanded Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Practically a regular,&rdquo; replied Darrell. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t count on Oswald any more, now that his busy
season has begun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every member of the Silver Stars save Sam had
shaken hands with Joe. The pitcher now stood
facing our hero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to protest!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Sam,
looking Joe full in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Darrell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What business is it of yours, anyhow, Sam?&rdquo;
asked the captain. &ldquo;Darrell and I have settled
this. Matson plays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I want my protest noted!&rdquo; went on
Sam angrily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to be a local team&mdash;every
one on it belongs in town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So does Joe Matson!&rdquo; broke in Tom Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s only just moved in, and how do we
know but what he&rsquo;ll move out again?&rdquo; demanded
Sam. &ldquo;I protest against him being a regular, or
even a substitute, member of the Silver Stars!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>JOE IN THE GAME</h3>


<p>There was a period of silence following Sam&rsquo;s
unfair protest. Then could be heard a low murmur
from some of his mates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s eating him, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he got against Matson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something has Sam by the ear all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, guess he didn&rsquo;t like the way the scrub
batted him around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were some of the comments made, not
loud enough for Sam to hear, for he was a power
in the nine, and none of the lads wanted to get on
bad terms with him.</p>

<p>For a moment all eyes were turned on Sam and
then toward Joe who, it can easily be imagined,
was much embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think your protest is a fair one,&rdquo; said
Darrell at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so either,&rdquo; added Captain
George Rankin. &ldquo;Just because Matson is a newcomer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in town is no reason why he can&rsquo;t play with
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; put in Seth Potter. &ldquo;You
weren&rsquo;t born here yourself, Sam, and neither were
lots of us. We moved here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived in Riverside nearly all my life,&rdquo;
snapped the pitcher, &ldquo;and I like to see a representative
team. If we need a new member why
not pick one who has been living here longer than
a couple of weeks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; exclaimed Darrell. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think this is fair to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; asked Sam, for the manager
had spoken with some warmth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just this much. You elected me manager and
the captain and I were to select the players. Now,
when we make our choice, there comes a kick. It
isn&rsquo;t right. Rankin and I decided to give Matson
a chance, and he gets it. That goes, too!&rdquo; and
the manager looked straight at Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you put it that way I suppose I
might as well keep still about it,&rdquo; and Sam, shrugging
his shoulders, turned away. He had not yet
shaken hands with Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for there being other players just as good
and who have lived here longer, that may be true,&rdquo;
went on Darrell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying Matson is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
only fellow I could pick for centre field, and I&rsquo;m
not saying anything against any of the fellows on
the scrub when I don&rsquo;t take them. We want the
best team we can get to represent the Silver Stars
and Matson is my choice for the place. If you
want to go over my head&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; came a chorus of objections.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Matson plays Saturday,&rdquo; concluded the
manager. &ldquo;All of you be out for practice to-morrow
afternoon again. Matson, report in uniform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and Joe&rsquo;s heart was fairly thumping
under his coat. The chance he had longed for
had come at last.</p>

<p>As Sam was walking away Joe resolved on a
bold stroke, rather a grandstand play as he confessed
to himself afterward, but he could not forego
it. Striding up to the disgruntled pitcher Joe
held out his hand and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you shake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam turned and faced him. For several seconds
he stood staring Joe straight in the eyes while the
crowd of boys looked on. Then with a sneer, and
ignoring the proffered hand, Sam said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I prefer to pick my own friends. I don&rsquo;t
want them made for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<p>He turned on his heel and walked off.</p>

<p>There was another period of silence like that
following his protest. Then some one said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad I haven&rsquo;t got <i>his</i> disposition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Sam angrily, and turning
back he seemed about to rush at the throng
he faced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now, that&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; exclaimed Darrell,
who was anxious to avoid a scene. &ldquo;Forget it,
fellows. Sam, you get your arm good and limber
for Saturday. We want to beat the Red Stockings
by a big score to make up for what the Resolutes
did to us last Saturday. I&rsquo;m going to arrange for
another game with them soon, and maybe we can
turn the tables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we can!&rdquo; cried several.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So limber up, Sam,&rdquo; the manager went on,
&ldquo;and have your arm in good shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be in bad shape if I get run down by
any more amateur cyclists,&rdquo; sneered Sam as he
looked meaningly at Joe, but no one made any
further reference to the recent collision.</p>

<p>At practice the next day Joe took his place with
the regular Silver Star team, and he showed up
well in the impromptu contest against the scrubs.
He made several good catches, and though his
stick work might have been improved, still it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
pretty good, for the scrub pitcher was not to be
despised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; complimented Darrell, at
the close of the contest. &ldquo;Keep it up, don&rsquo;t get
rattled, and you&rsquo;ll be all right. I can see you&rsquo;ve
played before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve got lots to learn yet,&rdquo; admitted
Joe cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we all have,&rdquo; assented the manager with
a laugh.</p>

<p>On the Saturday of the game with the Red
Stockings, Joe was up early. He had overhauled
his old uniform and gotten Clara to put a few
needed stitches in it. He had it out on the clothes
line in the back yard, beating some of the dust and
dirt from it to freshen it up, when Tom hailed him
from over the fence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Joe, what sort of a shirt have you got?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same one I used on the Bentville Boosters;
that was the name of our nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. A good name all right, but it will look
funny to see that in among the uniforms of the
Silver Stars. Your stockings and pants will do,
but the shirt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and Tom paused suggestively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; admitted Joe. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think
about that. It&rsquo;s a different color from yours, and
I haven&rsquo;t time to get another.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; called Tom. &ldquo;I tell you what
you can do. Use my shirt. It&rsquo;s the regular Star
one, with the name on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you want it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to get a chance to
play. Darrell will probably hold down first all
through the game. If I have to go in I can borrow
some other fellow&rsquo;s. But I want you to look
right from the start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; called Joe as Tom disappeared in
the house to get his shirt. It fitted Joe well, and
he arranged to get his own in time for the next
game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, there&rsquo;s a big crowd here all right!&rdquo; exclaimed
Joe, as he and Tom neared the enclosed
diamond that afternoon, and saw the stands well
filled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, so much the better. The Red Stockings
always draw well. I hope we beat. Do your
prettiest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I will. There&rsquo;s Sam warming up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I hope he doesn&rsquo;t go up in the air. Better
hurry up and get in practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe ran out on the diamond, which was thronged
with the home team and visiting players. Balls
were being caught and batted about, and the new
player was soon doing his share.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now keep cool,&rdquo; Darrell advised him, &ldquo;and
above all don&rsquo;t have a row with Sam. I can&rsquo;t
understand why he has such a grudge against you,
but he has and there&rsquo;s no use letting it be known
any more than it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do or say anything if he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
promised Joe. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to let him
knock me down and then wipe his feet on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;ll see that he&rsquo;s decent, anyhow.
Well, I guess it&rsquo;s time we started. I see
they have some new players. Maybe we won&rsquo;t
beat them as easily as I hoped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The practice balls were called in, players were
selecting their sticks, the batting order had been
decided on, and the final arrangements made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called the umpire, and the Silver
Stars took the field. Joe walked out to centre.
His heart was beating high. It was his first
chance to show what he could do in a match game
with his new team and he wanted to make good.
But oh! how he longed to be in the pitching box
occupied by Sam Morton!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called the umpire again, and
Sam, &ldquo;winding up,&rdquo; let fly a swift white ball
toward the expectant batter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>A TIGHT CONTEST</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Strike one!&rdquo; yelled the young umpire, as the
ball landed with a resounding thud in Bart Ferguson&rsquo;s
big mitt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; called several in the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send back the Reds with a whitewash brush,&rdquo;
added another enthusiast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess Sam&rsquo;s in form to-day,&rdquo; remarked Tom
Davis to Rodney Burke near whom he sat. Tom
was not playing, for Darrell was holding down
the initial bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit and see what happens along about
the seventh inning,&rdquo; said Rodney. &ldquo;Sam generally
falls down then if he&rsquo;s going to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope he doesn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said
Tom, and then he gave all his attention to watching
the game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ball one,&rdquo; was the next decision of the umpire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; cried Sam,
starting toward home where Bart stood holding
the ball. &ldquo;That clipped the plate as good as any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
one would want. You&rsquo;d better get a pair of
glasses, Kern. You can&rsquo;t see straight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see as well as you!&rdquo; retorted Frank
Kern, the umpire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t anywhere near over the plate,&rdquo; retorted
Jack King, the batter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, you don&rsquo;t know a good ball when you
get one,&rdquo; snapped Sam. &ldquo;I guess&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do now!&rdquo; called Darrell sharply
from first. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a kid game. Play ball.
Don&rsquo;t be always kicking, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is always kicking?&rdquo; demanded the
pitcher, and it was evident to all that he was in unusually
bad temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t on my account,&rdquo; thought Joe
who, from his position in deep centre, was waiting
for anything that might come his way. He
had been told to play far out, for King was known
as a heavy hitter.</p>

<p>Sam received the ball from Bart with a scowl
and wound up for the next delivery. Sam was a
natural pitcher. That is, he had good control, as
a rule, and he made his shoulder and back do most
of the work of the pitching arm, as all professionals
do. Still his unpleasant temper often made
his efforts go to waste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike two!&rdquo; called the umpire this time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
there was no doubt about it for King had swung
viciously at the ball. But Sam had sent in a puzzling
little drop, and the knowledge that he had
fooled a good batter brought a smile to his otherwise
scowling face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where I get you!&rdquo; he predicted.</p>

<p>But alas for his hopes! The bat met the ball
squarely and Sam had made the mistake of sending
a fast ball to a heavy hitter enabling King to
knock out a pretty three bagger. Far back as Joe
had stationed himself he was not far enough and
he had to turn and run after the horsehide. And
how he did run! He was thinking desperately
what would happen if he missed it! He made up
his mind that he would not, yet it was not within
the power of any one to get to the spot before
the ball fell.</p>

<p>Joe felt it graze the tips of his fingers as it
rushed downward but that was all. He heard
himself groan involuntarily in anguish as the ball
hit the ground with a thud. He lost no time in
idle regrets however, but picked it up and made a
throw to third in time to hold King there, for the
doughty player had a notion of continuing on
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good try old man!&rdquo; yelled some spectators
on the benches nearest Joe. He felt that his effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was somewhat appreciated but he wondered
what Darrell would think of it. Sam was scowling
again, whether at Joe&rsquo;s perfectly natural miss,
or the fact that he was hit for three bases was
impossible to guess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try for the next one,&rdquo; called Darrell cheerfully,
and Sam did with such success that Bigney,
who was second up for the Red Stockings, only
pounded out a little drizzler that Sam quickly
gathered in and threw to first. King was still
held on third. Smart fanned out, and then came
Steel, who, after knocking a couple of fouls, was
fooled on a little in-shoot which made three out,
King dying on third and the side being retired
with no runs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not so bad,&rdquo; said Sam as he walked in to
the bench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve got their number all right,&rdquo;
assented Darrell. He saw Joe coming in from
centre and the manager stopped to speak to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody could have gotten that ball,&rdquo; he said,
for he realized that the new player might blame
himself unjustly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think King had it in
him, or I&rsquo;d have told you to play out to the limit.
He won&rsquo;t get you that way again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess not!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe heartily.</p>

<p>The make up and batting order of the Silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Stars was the same as in the game with the Resolutes
save that Joe was in Jed McGraw&rsquo;s place,
and this brought him second to the bat. Potter
was up first and managed to get a single.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, bring him in,&rdquo; commanded Darrell with
a smile at Joe, as the latter picked out a bat. He
was very nervous, as any lad would have been,
playing his first game with a new team. He did
want to make good!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>

<p>Painter, the Red Stocking pitcher, had no phenomenal
speed and his curves could not be depended
on to break at the right places. Still he
was a good &ldquo;bluffer&rdquo; and he made many a batter
think that he was getting a very swift ball. Often
it would look as though it was going to hit the
man at the plate and he would instinctively step
back, disconcerting his own aim.</p>

<p>Joe let the first ball pass, and was somewhat
surprised to have a strike called on him. But he
did not kick, for, as a matter of fact, the horsehide
had clipped the plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the next one,&rdquo; thought Joe grimly.
Then Painter worked his usual trick, of throwing
a ball close in, and Joe bent his body like a bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike two!&rdquo; yelled the umpire and Joe felt
a flash of anger. But he said nothing, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the next ball came he swung viciously at it. He
heard the heart-stirring ping! and, dropping his
bat, he legged it for first as Potter darted to
second.</p>

<p>But Joe had not hit the ball nearly as hard as
he thought he had, and the result was that the
shortstop gathered it in, and, by a quick throw to
first, caught our hero there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, to second!&rdquo; yelled the coacher, but
Potter dropped and slid, being counted safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One down, only two more!&rdquo; yelled Murphy,
captain and catcher of the &ldquo;Reds,&rdquo; as they were
called for short.</p>

<p>Joe felt his face burning with shame as he
walked back to the bench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! I thought we were going to see
some wonders!&rdquo; murmured Sam Morton sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Matson&mdash;it was an even chance,
and you found the ball,&rdquo; said Darrell quickly.
He knew the danger of a new player becoming
discouraged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Joe quietly.</p>

<p>Lantry got a single which sent Potter to third,
but the next two men struck out and with two
men left on bases the Silver Stars had to take the
field again with only a goose egg to their credit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>The game ran along to the ending of the third
inning with neither side getting a run. Each team
made some scattering hits but the fielding was
evenly good, and no one crossed the home plate.
Joe made one fine catch in the beginning of the
third and received a round of applause that did
his heart good.</p>

<p>Sam was pitching pretty good ball, occasionally
being found for a two bagger, but any short-comings
in this line were more than made up in the
support he received from his mates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a tighter game than I thought
it was,&rdquo; murmured Darrell, at the close of the
fourth inning, when his side had managed to get
in one run to tie the tally which the Reds had
secured. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a better team than I gave
them credit for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to beat us, do
you?&rdquo; asked Sam anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;well&mdash;I hope not,&rdquo; was the hesitating answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that mean you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m doing all
I ought to?&rdquo; demanded the pitcher defiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I know you wouldn&rsquo;t throw
the game. Only I wish we could strike more of
them out,&rdquo; and the manager looked anxiously over
the field as his players were stationing themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see what I do this inning,&rdquo; invited
Sam. &ldquo;Perhaps you want that new fellow to go
in the box in my place.&rdquo; His voice was sneering
now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, Joe Matson?&rdquo; asked Darrell quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who I mean,&rdquo; replied Sam surlily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish,&rdquo; was the manager&rsquo;s quiet
answer. &ldquo;You know he hasn&rsquo;t had any experience
in the box&mdash;or at least enough to play on our
team, though I think he&rsquo;ll make a good fielder.
Now do your prettiest Sam. You can, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented the pitcher, and once
more the game was underway.</p>

<p>The fifth inning was productive of one run for
the Silver Stars and this after they had retired
their rivals hitless, for Sam did some excellent
pitching. There was a howl of delight as the first
tally came in, making the score two to one in favor
of our friends. And there was none out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we ought to walk away from them,&rdquo;
called Darrell to his players. Joe came up to bat
and to his delight he got a single. He was advanced
to second when the next player connected
with the ball, and then followed some see-sawing
on the part of the pitcher and the second baseman,
in an endeavor to catch Joe napping.</p>

<p>Once our hero thought he saw a good chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to steal third and he was about to take it when
something warned him to come back. He did,
and only just in time, for the pitcher threw to
second. It was a close shave.</p>

<p>Joe slid head foremost and as his fingers
touched the bag the second baseman leaped up in
the air to catch the ball which the pitcher had
wildly thrown high.</p>

<p>When the baseman came down, making a wild
effort to touch Joe, the iron cleat of one shoe
caught the little finger of Joe&rsquo;s left hand and cut
it cruelly.</p>

<p>The plucky centre fielder tried to stifle the
groan of anguish that rose to his lips, but it was
impossible. The baseman was aware of the accident.</p>

<p>Dropping the ball he knelt over Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty sorry, old man!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Are you hurt much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no. I&mdash;I guess not,&rdquo; murmured Joe,
and then all got black before his eyes, and there
was a curious roaring in his ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>JOE&rsquo;S RUN</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Water here! Bring some water!&rdquo; yelled
Smart, who was holding down second base for
the Reds. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fainted I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a rush of players toward Joe, and
Darrell was the first to reach him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, old man?&rdquo; he asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I spiked him,&rdquo; answered Smart,
ruefully. &ldquo;I jumped for the ball, and came down
on his hand I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; murmured Darrell.</p>

<p>They turned Joe over, for he was lying on his
face, and saw his left hand covered with blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that first-aid kit?&rdquo; called Tom
Davis, who had rushed on the field on seeing his
friend hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; answered Rodney Burke, who
acted as the amateur surgeon on the few times his
services had been required. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bandage it up.
Had we better get a doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile some water had been sprinkled in
Joe&rsquo;s face and some forced between his lips. He
opened his eyes as the others were washing the
blood from his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he murmured, as he strove
to rise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s all right&mdash;you just lie still,&rdquo; commanded
Darrell. &ldquo;Look at it Rod, and see how
bad it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortunately the wound was not as serious as
had at first seemed and when cleansed of dirt and
blood it was seen to be a long cut, lengthwise of
the finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that done up in a jiffy,&rdquo; remarked
Rodney, who was not a little proud of his skill.
His father was a physician, and had shown the
son how to make simple bandages. The wound
was cleansed with an antiseptic solution and
wrapped in the long narrow strips of bandage
cloth. Joe got to his feet while this was being
done, and, after a little water containing aromatic
spirits of ammonia had been given to him, he declared
that he was all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asked Darrell anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll bring in a run yet if some one knocks
the ball far enough,&rdquo; said Joe with a smile, though
it was rather a feeble one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, you can&rsquo;t run after that,&rdquo; exclaimed
Murphy, the Red captain. &ldquo;Give him a
man,&rdquo; he added generously to his rival. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I had better send Newton down to run
for you,&rdquo; said Captain Rankin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to play,&rdquo; insisted Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, next inning,&rdquo; he was assured, and the
game went on.</p>

<p>However, even the substitution of a runner in
Joe&rsquo;s place availed nothing, as the side was soon
afterward retired with the men expiring on bases,
and the one run was all the Silver Stars could
gather in. Still that made the score two to one in
their favor.</p>

<p>There was a big surprise in the next inning.
The Reds came to bat full of confidence, and the
first man up rapped out as pretty a three bagger
as had been pulled off that day. It went to deep
right field, for which Joe was thankful, as even
with his finger protected by a bandage and a heavy
glove on his hand, he felt that he would wince at
catching a swift ball, and might possibly muff it.
That was what the right fielder did, though he
managed to pick it up quickly enough to prevent
the player from going on in to home.</p>

<p>Whether the fact of being hit for a long poke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
made Sam lose his temper, or the knowledge that
part of his support consisted of a wounded player
made him nervous, was not manifest, but the fact
remains that the pitcher &ldquo;went up in the air&rdquo;
after that. He gave one man his base on balls,
and when the next player came up, and rapped out
a two bagger the man at third went on in, and
there was a man holding down third while one on
second nearly made the bases full.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy now,&rdquo; cautioned Darrell to Sam.
&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; grunted Sam, and what he meant by it
might be imagined, but he <i>did</i> strike out the next
two men. Then came a single which resulted in a
tally being made, being the second run of the
inning. Sam shut his teeth grimly. There were
now two out and two men on bases and Sam felt
his nerve leaving him. But by a strong effort he
braced himself, and did the trick to the next man,
stopping the winning streak of the Reds just in
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three to two against us,&rdquo; murmured Darrell
as he looked at the score board when he and his
mates came in for their turn at the bat. &ldquo;That
isn&rsquo;t going as I&rsquo;d like to see it. Say, fellows, we&rsquo;ve
got to knuckle down if we want to pull this game
out of the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; murmured George Rankin,
and, perhaps involuntarily, he glanced at Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know what you fellows mean without
you saying so!&rdquo; snapped the pitcher. &ldquo;I wish
you&rsquo;d keep your remarks to yourselves. I can
pitch all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one said you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Darrell
gently.</p>

<p>But it was very little that the Silver Stars could
accomplish. Two men went down to inglorious
defeat. The third knocked a nice single but died
on first when the Red pitcher with seeming ease
struck out the fourth batter. And it was not due
so much that the visiting boxman had speed or
curves, as to the fact that he could fool the batters
with easy balls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We seem to have struck a hoodoo,&rdquo; said Darrell
in despairing tones as they took the field
again. &ldquo;Sam, our only hope is in you. Not a run
for us this inning and they got two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t get any more!&rdquo; declared Sam
savagely.</p>

<p>He made good his boast, for not a man got beyond
second, and of those who performed this
feat there was but one. A big circle went up in
the Red&rsquo;s frame for the ending of the first half of
the seventh inning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p>But the Silver Stars fared no better, and for the
next inning the result was the same, neither side
being able to score. The tally was three runs to
two in favor of the visitors when the ninth inning
opened.</p>

<p>The Silver Stars didn&rsquo;t like to think of that
inning afterward. There were numerous errors,
wild throws and muffs. Joe let a ball slip through
his fingers when by holding it he might have prevented
a run, but it happened to hit on the cut
place, and the agony was such that he let out an
exclamation of pain.</p>

<p>But he was not the only one who sinned. Sam
was &ldquo;rotten,&rdquo; to quote Tom Davis, and &ldquo;issued
a number of passes.&rdquo; One man got to first by
virtue of being hit and when the inning was over
there were three runs in the Red&rsquo;s box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six to two against us,&rdquo; murmured Darrell.
&ldquo;It looks bad, fellows&mdash;it looks bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe was first up to the bat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can hit?&rdquo; asked the captain
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I can hold my little finger away
from the bat and I&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then hit for all you&rsquo;re worth,&rdquo; begged Darrell.
&ldquo;We need all we can get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe clenched his teeth grimly and made up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
mind he would not be fooled as he had been several
times before.</p>

<p>The Red pitcher was smiling in a tantalizing
way and Joe felt himself almost hating him for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hit you! I&rsquo;m going to hit you!&rdquo;
he found himself murmuring over and over again
in his mind.</p>

<p>And hit Joe did. The first delivery was a ball,
but the second Joe knew was just where he wanted
it. With all his force he swung at it and as he
sped away toward first, with all the power of his
legs he saw the horsehide sailing on a clean hit in
a long, low drive over the centre fielder&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Joe heard the ball strike the farther fence and
a wild hope came into his heart that he might
make a home run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do it! I&rsquo;m going to do!&rdquo; he
whispered to himself as he turned first and sped
like the wind for second base. Could he beat the
ball in? That was what he was asking himself.
That was what hundreds of frantic fans were asking
themselves.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>DISCONTENT</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Leg it, Joe! Leg it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep on! Keep on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t get you in time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A home run! A homer, old man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep a-going! Keep a-going!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These and other frantic appeals and bits of
advice were hurled at Joe as he dashed madly on.
He had a glimpse of the centre fielder racing madly
after the ball, and then he felt for the first time
that he really had a chance to make a home run.
Still he knew that the ball travels fast when once
thrown, and it might be relayed in, for he saw the
second baseman running back to assist the centre
fielder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to beat it!&rdquo; panted Joe to himself.</p>

<p>The grandstand and bleachers were now a mass
of yelling excited spectators. There was a good
attendance at the game, many women and girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
being present, and Joe could hear their shrill
voices mingling with the hoarser shouts of the
men and boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep on! Keep on!&rdquo; he heard yelled encouragingly
at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff, old man!&rdquo; shouted Darrell,
who was coaching at the third base line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I go in?&rdquo; cried Joe as he turned the
last bag.</p>

<p>Darrell took a swift glance toward the field.
He saw what Joe could not. The centre fielder
instead of relaying in the ball by the second baseman
(for the throw was too far for him), had
attempted to get it to third alone. Darrell knew
it would fall short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; he howled. &ldquo;Go on in, Joe!
Go on in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Joe went.</p>

<p>Just as the manager had anticipated, the ball
fell short, and the pitcher who had run down to
cover second had to run out of the diamond to
get it. It was an error in judgment, and helped
Joe to make his sensational run.</p>

<p>He was well on his way home now, but the
pitcher had the ball and was throwing it to the
catcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slide, Joe! Slide!&rdquo; yelled Darrell above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wild tumult of the other players and the spectators.</p>

<p>Joe kept on until he knew a slide would be
effective and then, dropping like a shot, he fairly
tore through the dust, feet first, toward home
plate. His shoes covered it as the ball came
with a thud into the outstretched hands of the
catcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; yelled the umpire, and there was no
questioning his decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good play!&rdquo; yelled the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff, old man!&rdquo; exclaimed Darrell,
rushing up and clapping Joe on the back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few more like that and the game will either
go ten innings or we&rsquo;ll have it in the ice-box for
ourselves,&rdquo; commented Captain Rankin gleefully.</p>

<p>But the hopes of the Silver Stars were doomed
to disappointment. Try as the succeeding men
did to connect with the ball, the best that could be
knocked out was a single, and that was not effective,
for the man who did it was caught attempting
to steal second and two others were struck
out.</p>

<p>That ended the game, Joe&rsquo;s solitary run being
the only one tallied up, and the final score was
three to six in favor of the Red Stockings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the Silver Stars!&rdquo; called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the captain of the successful nine and they were
given with right good feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the Red Stockings,&rdquo; responded
Darrell. &ldquo;They were too much for us,&rdquo;
and the cheers of the losers were none less hearty
than those of their rivals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And three cheers for the fellow who made
the home run!&rdquo; added a Red Stocking player, and
our hero could not help blushing as he was thus
honored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was all to the pepper-castor, old man,&rdquo;
complimented Darrell. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t put up a very
good game, but you sort of stand out among the
other Stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose the rest of us did rotten!&rdquo;
snarled Sam Morton as he walked past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to be frank, I think we <i>all</i> did,&rdquo; spoke
Darrell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that Joe didn&rsquo;t make
any errors, for he did. But he made the only
home run of the game, and that&rsquo;s a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; sneered the disgruntled
pitcher. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be blaming me next
for the loss of the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; exclaimed Darrell
quickly. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve all got to bear our share
of the defeat. We ought to have played better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and we&rsquo;ve got to, if we don&rsquo;t want to be at the tail
end of the county league.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that means that I&rsquo;ve got to do better
pitching, I suppose?&rdquo; sneered Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means we&rsquo;ve <i>all</i> got to do better work,&rdquo;
put in Captain Rankin. &ldquo;You along with the
rest of us, Sam. You know you were pretty well
batted to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any fellow is likely to be swatted once in a
while. Look at some of the professionals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; admitted the captain.
&ldquo;What I do say is that we&rsquo;ve all got to
perk up. We&rsquo;ve got to take a brace, and I&rsquo;m not
sparing myself. We&rsquo;re not doing well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; admitted several other players.
In fact there was a general feeling of discontent
manifested, and it was very noticeable.
Darrell Blackney was aware of it, and he hoped it
would not spread, for nothing is so sure to make a
team slump as discontent or dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Joe!&rdquo; exclaimed a girl&rsquo;s voice, and he
turned to see his sister walking toward him over
the field. &ldquo;That was a fine run you made.&rdquo; She
had two other girls with her and Joe, who was a
bit bashful, turned to execute a retreat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you never met my brother,&rdquo; went on
Clara, and there was a trace of pride in her tone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
&ldquo;Miss Mabel Davis,&rdquo; said Clara, presenting her
to Joe, &ldquo;and Miss Helen Rutherford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard my sister speak of you,&rdquo; murmured
the young centre fielder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve heard my brother speak of <i>you</i>,&rdquo;
said Mabel, and Joe was conscious that he was
blushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to wash up now,&rdquo; he said, not knowing
what to talk about when two pretty girls, to
say nothing of his own sister, were staring at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does your hand hurt you much?&rdquo; asked
Mabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;it&rsquo;s only a scratch,&rdquo; said Joe, not with
a strict regard for the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought I&rsquo;d faint when I saw you lying
there so still,&rdquo; spoke Clara with a little shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; added Helen, and then Joe made
his escape before they could &ldquo;fuss&rdquo; over him
any more.</p>

<p>There was considerable talk going on in the
dressing room when Joe entered. He could hear
the voice of Sam Morton raised in high and seemingly
angry tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to stand for it!&rdquo; the
pitcher said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand for what?&rdquo; asked Darrell in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Being accused of the cause for the loss of this
game!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one accuses you,&rdquo; put in the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might as well say it as look it,&rdquo; retorted
Sam. &ldquo;I tell you I won&rsquo;t stand for it. Just because
that new fellow made a home run you&rsquo;re all
up in the air about him, and for all the hard work
I do, what do I get for it? Eh? Nothing, that&rsquo;s
what!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said Darrell soothingly,
&ldquo;you know you&rsquo;re talking foolishly, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not!&rdquo; cried the pitcher petulantly.
&ldquo;Either Joe Matson leaves the team or I do, and
you can have my resignation any time you want
it!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE</h3>


<p>There was a period of silence following Sam&rsquo;s
offer of his resignation, and no one seemed to
know just what to say. Several of the lads glanced
at Joe, as if expecting him to say something in his
own defense. In fact the young centre fielder was
about to speak but he did not get the chance, for
Sam exclaimed again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do you want my resignation, Darrell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; declared the manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then things have got to be changed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; burst out Darrell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood
about all I&rsquo;m going to from you, Sam Morton.
There has got to be a change in this team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m giving you a chance to
make,&rdquo; the pitcher fairly sneered. &ldquo;You can fill
my place any time you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to,&rdquo; and though Darrell
spoke pleasantly there was a sternness in his
words. &ldquo;Fellows, it&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;The Silver Stars are a good team and you know
it. So does every one in this town, but the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
two games we&rsquo;ve played in hard luck, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say it was my pitching?&rdquo; demanded
Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more than it was the way we all played.
As I said, we&rsquo;ve got to take a brace. I don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s gotten into you, Sam, to say you&rsquo;ll resign if
Joe Matson plays. What have you against him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hate to see a newcomer made so much
of. Here we fellows have worked hard all season,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to work hard the <i>rest</i> of the
season!&rdquo; exclaimed Darrell. &ldquo;Let me tell you
that! I&rsquo;m not going to hear any more talk of
resignations, and this bickering has got to stop.
Otherwise we&rsquo;ll be the laughing stock of the
county. You all played pretty well to-day, but
you all need to do better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All but Matson; I suppose he&rsquo;s the star,&rdquo;
sneered Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; burst out Joe, unable to stand
the taunts of the pitcher any longer, &ldquo;if you
think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, go easy,&rdquo; advised Darrell with a smile.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving this little lecture. I give Matson due
credit for one of the three runs we got,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s not saying that he didn&rsquo;t make
errors. We all did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fellows!&rdquo; he pleaded and they could see
that he was very much in earnest, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get together
and wallop every nine we play against
from now on! Take a brace. Forget all this feeling
and get together. Matson and Morton, I
want you to shake hands, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing,&rdquo; assented Joe eagerly, advancing
toward Sam.</p>

<p>The latter hesitated a moment and then, feeling
the eyes of all in the dressing room on him, he
mumbled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as long as you don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the star
of the Stars, I&rsquo;ll shake. Maybe I was a bit hasty,&rdquo;
he went on, and this was a great deal for Sam
Morton to admit. He and Joe shook hands,
though it cannot be said that there was any warmth
on the part of the pitcher. Still it was better than
open enmity, though Joe wondered if Sam would
be really friendly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; commented the manager with
something like a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t let this go any further,&rdquo; suggested
the captain. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want it known that there
came near being a break in the Stars. Now get
together, fellows. Show up at practice strong next
time, and we&rsquo;ll win our next game!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo; cried Tom Davis,
and the crisis was passed&mdash;for a time.</p>

<p>And, to the delight of Joe, he found that he
had made many new friends, chiefly because of his
sensational run. The members of the team, of
course, crowded around him congratulating him,
and asking him how he did it. But, in addition,
there now flocked into the dressing room a crowd
of lads who had witnessed the game. Some of
them were high school pupils who knew Joe, at
least by sight, but they now came up and spoke to
him. Other town lads did the same thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! It&rsquo;s great to be popular!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom, with a mock sigh. &ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t I born a
home-run hitter instead of good looking, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; laughed Joe. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me
get a swelled head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No danger, I guess,&rdquo; retorted Tom.</p>

<p>Darrell and the captain strolled up to Joe, who
had finished dressing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s over, for a while,&rdquo; said Darrell
in a low voice, evidently referring to the unpleasant
little incident. &ldquo;I want to ask you to do some
practicing, Matson. You need to try throwing a
bit, for it&rsquo;s a long heave in from centre field and,
to be frank, you aren&rsquo;t any too good at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll practice every day,&rdquo; exclaimed our hero
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll coach him,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out, you lobster, you need coaching yourself,&rdquo;
said the captain with a laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get
rusty if Darrell doesn&rsquo;t get off first and give you
a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it more often now,&rdquo; said the manager.
&ldquo;I want to be more on the coaching line. Two
wallops in two weeks is more than the Stars can
stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do we play next week?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Denville Whizzers, but I don&rsquo;t imagine
we&rsquo;ll have much trouble with them,&rdquo; said the manager.
&ldquo;However, it won&rsquo;t do to take any chances.
Practice hard, fellows,&rdquo; and with that he left the
dressing room.</p>

<p>Sam Morton had gone out some time before
and Joe and Tom soon followed. As they strolled
down the street toward their homes Tom said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say Joe, I was in earnest in saying I&rsquo;d coach
you. I believe you do need practice in throwing,
and if you haven&rsquo;t given up the idea of pitching
some day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never give up the idea until I&rsquo;m knocked
out of the box,&rdquo; declared Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Then I&rsquo;ll help coach you. I was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to say it wasn&rsquo;t much fun practicing alone, and
as a matter of fact it doesn&rsquo;t do much good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been reading up about baseball
lately. I got a book on pitching, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, will you lend it to me?&rdquo; asked Joe eagerly.
&ldquo;Or tell me where I can buy one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I will. I was going to say that it has
articles in it by star professional pitchers and a lot
of them agree that it isn&rsquo;t much use just to go out
and throw a ball at a spot on the backstop or the
fence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the best way then?&rdquo; asked Joe, who
had supposed from his limited knowledge that to
practice at hitting a certain spot with the ball was
about the best he could do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, they say the best is to get something
like a home plate&mdash;a flat stone say&mdash;and pitch
over it with some one to catch for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that would be a good way,&rdquo; began
Joe doubtfully, &ldquo;but who&rsquo;s going to catch for
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom quickly. &ldquo;I said just
now that I&rsquo;d coach you. I&rsquo;ll do more than that,
I&rsquo;ll catch for you. And the book I spoke of has
other tricks of practice, so a fellow can get good
control of a ball. That&rsquo;s the thing pitchers need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
it says&mdash;control. Say, we&rsquo;ll have some fun, you
and I, down in a vacant lot practicing. When
can you come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about Monday afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suits me first rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll make it then, and we&rsquo;ll get in
some scientific practice for you. Maybe after all,
you&rsquo;ll pitch in Sam&rsquo;s place before the season is
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to do it, if it&rsquo;s going to make
a row in the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let that worry you. Lots of the
fellows don&rsquo;t like Sam any too well. They&rsquo;d as
soon have some one else in the box if he could
deliver the goods. Well, so long; see you Monday,
if not before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m glad dad moved to Riverside after
all,&rdquo; mused Joe as he walked toward home. &ldquo;I
was afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t like it at first, but now I&rsquo;m
on the team it&rsquo;s all right. I hope dad doesn&rsquo;t have
any business troubles though. I wonder what is
wrong for I&rsquo;m sure something is. I hope it
doesn&rsquo;t prevent me from going to boarding school
next year,&rdquo; and with this reflection Joe went in
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>A KETTLE OF APPLE SAUCE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well, Joe, are you all ready?&rdquo; It was Tom
Davis, and he had called at Joe&rsquo;s house on his way
from school, as Tom had to remain in physics
class to finish an experiment, and Joe had gone
on ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sure am, Tom. Where are we going to
practice? Over on the fairgrounds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s too far. We&rsquo;ll go down in the
vacant lots back of Mrs. Peterkin&rsquo;s house. There&rsquo;s
a high fence back of her house and that will be a
good backstop, in case I can&rsquo;t hold your hot ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess you can all right,&rdquo; replied Joe
with a laugh, &ldquo;though I wish I did have lots of
speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say now, don&rsquo;t make that mistake,&rdquo; said Tom
earnestly, as Joe came out to join him, having
picked up some old balls and a pitcher&rsquo;s glove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What mistake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trying for speed before you have control. I
saw an article about that in the pitching book last
night. I brought it along. Here it is,&rdquo; and both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
boys looked eagerly over the book as they walked
along.</p>

<p>As Tom had said, some of the best authorities
on pitching did advocate the trying for control before
a prospective boxman endeavored to get
either speed or curves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing seems to be,&rdquo; remarked Joe, &ldquo;to
get a ball just where you want it, ten times out of
ten if you can, and then when you can do that, try
for the in and out shoots and the drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;Are you any good
at throwing stones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one fellow says that the lad who can
throw a stone straight can generally throw a ball
straight. We&rsquo;ll have a contest when we get down
to the lots. Nobody will see us there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; remarked Joe. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
to be laughed at the way I was when Sam caught
me down at the fairgrounds. I guess he thought
I was trying for his place then, and that&rsquo;s what
made him mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two friends were soon down behind the
high board fence that marked the boundaries of
the Peterkin property. It was rather a large
place&mdash;the Peterkin one&mdash;and was occupied by an
aged couple. Mrs. Alvirah Peterkin was quite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
housewife, always engaged in some kitchen or
other household duties, while Ebenezer, her husband
&ldquo;puttered&rdquo; around the garden, as the folks
of Riverside expressed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;re all ready,&rdquo; remarked
Tom, when he had picked out a large flat stone to
represent home plate. He took his position behind
it, with his back to the fence, so that if any
balls got by him they would hit the barrier and
bound back.</p>

<p>Joe began to pitch, endeavoring to bear in mind
what the book had said about getting the balls
where he wanted them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was pretty far out from the plate,&rdquo;
called Tom dubiously, after one effort on the part
of his chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it was. Here&rsquo;s a better one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s the stuff. It was a strike all
right&mdash;right over the middle. Keep it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a time Joe kept this up, pitching at moderate
speed, and then the temptation to &ldquo;cut
loose&rdquo; could not be resisted. He &ldquo;wound up&rdquo; as
he had seen professional pitchers do and let the
ball go. With considerable force it went right
through Tom&rsquo;s hands and crashed up against the
fence with a resounding bang. It was the first
ball Tom had let get past him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a hot one all right!&rdquo; the catcher
called, &ldquo;but it was away out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll slow down again,&rdquo; said Joe. He
was a little disappointed that he could not combine
speed and accuracy.</p>

<p>The boys were about to resume their practice
when a face, fringed with a shock of white hair on
top, and a little ring of whiskers encircling it below,
was raised over the edge of the fence, and a
mild voice demanded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you boys up to now&mdash;tryin&rsquo; to knock
down my fence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Mr. Peterkin,&rdquo; called Tom.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just playing baseball&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the rest of ye?&rdquo; the old man wanted
to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all there are of us,&rdquo; replied Tom,
waving his hand toward Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Fust time I ever heard of two boys
playin&rsquo; a ball game all by themselves,&rdquo; commented
the aged man with a chuckle. &ldquo;But I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s
one of them new-fangled kind. Land sakes, what
th&rsquo; world a-comin&rsquo; t&rsquo; anyhow, I&rsquo;d like t&rsquo; know?
Wa&rsquo;al, keep on, only don&rsquo;t knock any boards offen
my fence,&rdquo; he stipulated as he resumed the making
of his garden.</p>

<p>The boys laughingly promised and resumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
their practice. Tom was a good catcher and he
had an accurate eye. He did not hesitate to tell
Joe when the balls were bad and he was a severe
critic, for he had taken an honest liking to the
newcomer, and wanted to see him succeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just try for control,&rdquo; was the gist of his advice.
&ldquo;The rest if it will take care of itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to pitch and let me catch for
you?&rdquo; asked Joe after a bit, fearing that he was
somewhat selfish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t specially need any practice at
throwing,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;First is my position. I
like it better than any other, and catching is the
best practice I can have for that. Keep it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Joe kept on, using moderate speed after the
warning of Mr. Peterkin, so that no more balls
struck the fence. But then again came the almost
irresistible desire to put on &ldquo;steam,&rdquo; and indulging
in this Joe sent in another &ldquo;hot one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost the instant it left his hand Joe realized
that he had lost control of the ball and that it was
going wild. He instinctively reached out to pull
it back, but it was too late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grab it!&rdquo; he yelled to Tom.</p>

<p>The plucky little first baseman made a magnificent
jump up in the air, but the ball merely grazed
the tip of his up-stretched glove. Then it went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
over the fence at undiminished speed. An instant
later there was the cry of alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did that?&rdquo; demanded the voice&mdash;a
voice full of anger. &ldquo;Who threw that ball? Oh!
Oh! Of all things! I demand to know who did
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe and Tom were silent&mdash;looking blankly one
at the other. Up over the fence rose the mild and
bewhiskered face of Mr. Peterkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; asked the aged man gently. &ldquo;Did
anything happen? It sounds like it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I threw the ball over the fence,&rdquo; admitted
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum! Then I&rsquo;m afraid something <i>did</i> happen,&rdquo;
went on Mr. Peterkin still more gently.
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> of it,&rdquo; he added as the sound of
some one coming down the garden path could be
heard. &ldquo;Here comes Alvirah. Something has
happened. Do&mdash;do you want to run?&rdquo; he asked,
for rumor had it that Mrs. Peterkin was possessed
of no gentle temper and Mr. Peterkin&mdash;well, he
was a very mild-mannered man, every one knew
that. &ldquo;Do you want to run?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; added Joe. &ldquo;If we broke a
window we&rsquo;ll pay for it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll pay for it,&rdquo; he corrected
himself, for he had thrown the ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs. Peterkin advanced to where her husband
was working in the garden. The boys could not
see the lady but they could hear her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t throw that ball, did you, Ebenezer?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;If you did&mdash;at your age&mdash;cutting
up such foolish tricks as playing baseball&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Alvirah, I didn&rsquo;t do it, of course not,&rdquo;
Mr. Peterkin hastened to say. &ldquo;It was a couple
of boys. Tom Davis and a friend of his. They
were playing ball back of the fence and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ve run off now, I&rsquo;ll venture!&rdquo; exclaimed
the rasping voice of Mrs. Peterkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t think so, Alvirah,&rdquo; said Mr.
Peterkin mildly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I rather think they&rsquo;re there
yet. I asked &rsquo;em if they didn&rsquo;t want to run
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;asked them&mdash;if&mdash;they&mdash;didn&rsquo;t&mdash;want&mdash;to&mdash;run?&rdquo;
gasped Mrs. Peterkin, as if unable
to believe his words. &ldquo;Why, the very&mdash;idea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I knew they&rsquo;d pay for any damage they
did,&rdquo; said her husband quickly, &ldquo;and I&mdash;er&mdash;I
sort of thought&mdash;well, anyhow they&rsquo;re over
there,&rdquo; and he pointed to the fence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see them! Let me talk to them!&rdquo; demanded
Mrs. Peterkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand on that soap box an&rsquo; ye kin see over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the fence,&rdquo; said Mr. Peterkin. &ldquo;But look out.
The bottom is sort of soft an&rsquo; ye may&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not finish his sentence. The very accident
he feared had happened. Mrs. Peterkin, being
a large and heavy woman, had stepped in the
middle of the box. The bottom boards, being old,
had given way and there she was&mdash;stuck with both
feet in the soap box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ebenezer!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Help me! Don&rsquo;t
you know any better than to stand there staring at
me? Haven&rsquo;t you got any senses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll help you, Alvirah,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I rather thought you&rsquo;d go through that box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d no business to let me use it!&rdquo; she
snapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It allers held <i>me</i> up when I wanted to look
over the fence,&rdquo; he said mildly. &ldquo;But then of
course I never stepped in the middle of it,&rdquo; he
added as he helped his wife pull aside the broken
boards so she could step out. &ldquo;I kept on the
edges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have those boys gone?&rdquo; she demanded when
free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I&rsquo;ll look,&rdquo; he volunteered
as he turned the soap box up on edge and peered
over the fence. &ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re here yet,&rdquo; he answered
as he saw Joe and Tom standing there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
trying their best not to laugh. &ldquo;Was you wantin&rsquo;
to speak with &rsquo;em, Alvirah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak with them! Of course I do!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Tell them to come around to the side gate. I&rsquo;ll
<i>speak</i> to them,&rdquo; and she drew herself up like an
angry hen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did&mdash;did they smash a window?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Peterkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smash a window? I only wish it was no
worse than that!&rdquo; cried his wife. &ldquo;They threw
their nasty baseball into a kettle of apple sauce
that was stewing on the stove, and the sauce
splashed all over my clean kitchen. Tell them to
come around. I&rsquo;ll <i>speak</i> to them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess you&rsquo;d better come in, boys,&rdquo; said
Mr. Peterkin softly, as he delivered the message
over the fence. Then he added&mdash;but to himself&mdash;&ldquo;Maybe
you might better have run while you had
the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for it I guess,&rdquo; murmured Tom, as
he and Joe went around to the side gate.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>JOE OVERHEARS SOMETHING</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Are you the boys who threw the baseball
through my kitchen window into my kettle of
apple sauce?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Peterkin, as she
confronted the two culprits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I threw it,&rdquo; admitted Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t know it went into the apple
sauce,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor through the window,&rdquo; spoke Joe for
want of something better to say. &ldquo;It was a wild
throw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; exclaimed the irate lady. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what kind of a throw it was but I
know <i>I</i> was wild when I saw my kitchen. I never
saw such a sight in all my born days&mdash;never! You
come and look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if you please I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; said Joe
quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you whatever damages you
say, but I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just want you to see that kitchen!&rdquo; insisted
Mrs. Peterkin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s surprising how mischievous
boys can be when they try.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t try,&rdquo; put in Tom. &ldquo;This was
an accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and see my kitchen!&rdquo; repeated Mrs.
Peterkin firmly and she seemed capable of taking
them each by an ear and leading them in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; advised Mr. Peterkin
gently.</p>

<p>So they went, and truly the sight that met their
eyes showed them that Mrs. Peterkin had some
excuse for being angry. On the stove there had
been cooking a large kettle of sauce made from
early apples. The window near the stove had
been left open and through the casement the ball,
thrown with all Joe&rsquo;s strength, had flown, landing
fairly into the middle of the soft sauce.</p>

<p>The result may easily be imagined. It splattered
all over the floor, half way up on the side
walls, and there were even spots of the sauce on
the ceiling. The top of the stove was covered with
it, and as the lids were hot they had burned the
sugar to charcoal, while the kitchen was filled with
smoke and fumes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Peterkin, as she waved
her hand at the scene of ruin. &ldquo;Did you ever see
such a kitchen as that? And it was clean scrubbed
only this morning! Did you ever see anything like
that? Tell me!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>Joe and Tom were both forced to murmur that
they had never beheld such a sight before. And
they added with equal but unexpressed truth that
they hoped they never would again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to pay for the damage,&rdquo; said Joe
once more, and his hand went toward his pocket.
&ldquo;It was an accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was,&rdquo; sniffed Mrs. Peterkin. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t say that it wasn&rsquo;t, but that won&rsquo;t clean my
kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe caught at these words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to help you clean up!&rdquo; he exclaimed
eagerly. &ldquo;I often help at home when my
mother is sick. Let me do it, and I&rsquo;ll pay for the
apple sauce I spoiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; put in Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is your mother?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Peterkin,
looking at Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Matson,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re the new family that moved into
town?&rdquo; and there was something of a change in
the irate lady&rsquo;s manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we live in the big yellow house near&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right back of our place, Mrs. Peterkin,&rdquo;
put in Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum! I&rsquo;ve been intending to call on your
mother,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Peterkin, ignoring Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
&ldquo;I always call on all the new arrivals in town, but
I&rsquo;ve been so busy with my housework and Spring
cleaning&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused and gazed about the kitchen. <i>That</i>,
at least, would need cleaning over again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;I always call and invite
them to join our Sewing and Dorcas Societies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother belonged to both!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe
eagerly. &ldquo;That is in Bentville where we lived.
I heard her saying she wondered if there was a
society here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Peterkin majestically,
&ldquo;and I think I shall call soon, and ask her
to join. You may tell her I said so,&rdquo; she added
as if it was a great honor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;And now if you&rsquo;ll
tell me where I can get some old cloths I&rsquo;ll help
clean up this muss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peterkin slowly.
Clearly her manner had undergone a great change.
&ldquo;I suppose boys must have their fun,&rdquo; she said
with something like a sigh. &ldquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t
mean to do it, but my apple sauce is spoiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for it,&rdquo; offered Joe eagerly. He was
beginning to see a rift in the trouble clouds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peterkin, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right. I
have plenty more apples.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us help clean the place?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with as near a
laugh as she ever indulged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any
men folks traipsing around my kitchen. I&rsquo;ll clean
it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let us black the stove for you,&rdquo; offered
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Alvirah,&rdquo; put in Mr. Peterkin quickly.
He rather sided with the boys, and he was
glad that the mention of Joe&rsquo;s mother, and the
possibility of Mrs. Peterkin getting a new member
for the societies, of both of which she was president,
had taken her mind off her desire for revenge.
&ldquo;Let the boys black the stove. You
know you always hate that work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose they could do <i>that</i>,&rdquo; she admitted
somewhat reluctantly. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t splatter
it all over, though the land knows this kitchen
can&rsquo;t be worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Behold then, a little later, two of the members
of the Silver Star nine industriously cleaning hardened
apple sauce off the Peterkin kitchen stove,
and blackening it until it shone brightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Sam Morton can&rsquo;t see us,&rdquo; spoke
Tom in a whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we&rsquo;d never hear the last of it,&rdquo; agreed
Joe.</p>

<p>They finished the work and even Mrs. Peterkin,
careful housekeeper that she was, admitted that
the stove &ldquo;looked fairly good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And be sure and tell your mother that I&rsquo;m
coming to call on her,&rdquo; she added, as Joe and Tom
were about to leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered the centre fielder, and
then he paused on the threshold of the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten something?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Peterkin, who was preparing to give the place a
thorough scrubbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s their baseball, I guess,&rdquo; put in Mr. Peterkin.
&ldquo;It is in the kettle of apple sass, Alvirah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; so it is,&rdquo; she agreed, and this time
she really laughed. &ldquo;Well, you may have it,&rdquo;
she added. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo; With a dipper she
fished it up from the bottom of the kettle, put it
under the water faucet to clean it, and held it out
to Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said as he took it and hurried off
with Tom, before anything more could be said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, when they were out
in the lots again. &ldquo;That was a hot time while it
lasted. And we got out of it mighty lucky, thanks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to your mother. Mrs. Peterkin is great on the
society business, and I guess she thought if she
gave it to us too hot your mother wouldn&rsquo;t call on
her. Yes, we were lucky all right. Want to practice
some more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-day,&rdquo; replied Joe with a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had enough. Besides, this ball is all wet and slippery.
Anyhow there&rsquo;s lots more time, and I guess
the next day we do it we&rsquo;ll go down to the fairgrounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s more room there, and no kettles
of apple sauce,&rdquo; agreed Tom, with a laugh.</p>

<p>As Tom had an errand to do down town for his
father he did not accompany Joe back to their
respective homes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you to-night,&rdquo; he called to his chum,
as they parted, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll arrange for some more
practice. I think it&rsquo;s doing you good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know my arm is a bit sore,&rdquo; complained Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you want to take good care of it,&rdquo; said
Tom quickly. &ldquo;All the authorities in the book
say that a pitching arm is too valuable to let anything
get the matter with it. Bathe it with witch
hazel to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will. So long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Joe had not many lessons to prepare that
night, and as it was still rather early and he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
not want to go home, he decided to take a little
walk out in the country for a short distance. As
he trudged along he was thinking of many things,
but chief of all was his chances for becoming at
least a substitute pitcher on the Silver Stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could get in the box, and was sure of
going to boarding school, I wouldn&rsquo;t ask anything
else in this world,&rdquo; said Joe to himself. Like all
boys he had his ambitions, and he little realized
how such ambitions would change as he became
older. But they were sufficient for him now.</p>

<p>Before he knew it he had covered several miles,
for the day was a fine Spring one, just right for
walking, and his thoughts, being subject to quick
changes, his feet kept pace with them.</p>

<p>As he made a turn in the road he saw, just ahead
of him, an old building that had once, so some of
the boys had told him, been used as a spring-house
for cooling the butter and milk of the farm to
which it belonged. But it had now fallen into disuse,
though the spring was there yet.</p>

<p>The main part of it was covered by the shed,
but the water ran out into a hollowed-out tree
trunk where a cocoanut shell hung as a dipper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have a drink,&rdquo; mused Joe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as
dry as a fish and that&rsquo;s fine water.&rdquo; He had once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
taken some when he and Tom Davis took a country
stroll.</p>

<p>As he was sipping the cool beverage he heard
inside the old shed the murmur of voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum! Tramps I guess,&rdquo; reasoned Joe to
himself. But a moment later he knew it could not
be tramps for the words he heard were these:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you think you can get control of the
patents?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t
know about the reverting clause in his contract,
and he&rsquo;s working on a big improvement in a
corn&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the voice died away, though Joe strained
his ears in vain to catch the other words. Somehow
he felt vaguely uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have I heard that first voice before?&rdquo;
he murmured, racking his brains. Then like a flash
it came to him. The quick, incisive tones were
those of Mr. Rufus Holdney, of Moorville, to
whom he had once gone with a letter from Mr.
Matson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you can get the patents,&rdquo; went on
Mr. Holdney, &ldquo;then it means a large sum of
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For both of us,&rdquo; came the eager answer, and
Joe wondered whom the other man could be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure there won&rsquo;t be any slip-up?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Holdney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Positively. But come on. We&rsquo;ve been here
long enough and people might talk if they saw us
here together. Yet I wanted to have a talk with
you in a quiet place, and this was the best one I
could think of. I own this old farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then I&rsquo;ll be getting back to Moorville.
Be sure to keep me informed how the thing
goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a movement inside the shed as if the
men were coming out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better make myself scarce,&rdquo; thought Joe.</p>

<p>He had just time to drop down behind a screen
of bushes when the two men did emerge. Joe had
no need to look to tell who one was, but he was
curious in regard to the other. Cautiously he
peered up, and his heart almost stopped beating as
he recognized Mr. Isaac Benjamin, the manager
of the Royal Harvester Works where the boy&rsquo;s
father was employed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some crooked work on hand, I&rsquo;ll bet
a cookie!&rdquo; murmured Joe, as he crouched down
again while the two men walked off up the country
road.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>MR. MATSON IS ALARMED</h3>


<p>Joe Matson did not know what to do. He
wanted to rush away from where he was concealed,
get home as quickly as possible, and tell
his father what he had overheard. While Mr.
Matson&rsquo;s name had not been mentioned, knowing,
as Joe did, that his parent was engaged on some
patents, seeing Mr. Benjamin, manager of the
Harvester works, and having heard the conversation
between him and Mr. Holdney, the lad was
almost certain that some danger threatened his
father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet I can&rsquo;t get away from here until
they&rsquo;re well out of sight,&rdquo; reasoned Joe. &ldquo;If I
go now they&rsquo;ll see or hear me, and they&rsquo;ll be
bound to suspect something. Yet I&rsquo;d like to warn
dad as soon as I can. There&rsquo;s no telling when they
may put up some job against him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Joe could only crouch down there and wait.</p>

<p>At length he could stand it no longer. He reasoned
that the men must be far enough away by
this time to make it safe for him to emerge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re on the road to Riverside,&rdquo; thought
Joe, &ldquo;and I may run into them, but if I see them
I can slip into the fields and go around. Mr. Benjamin
doesn&rsquo;t know me, for he&rsquo;s hardly ever
noticed me when I&rsquo;ve been to the Harvester works
to see dad. But Mr. Holdney might remember
me. I can&rsquo;t take any chances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cautiously he emerged from the bushes, and
looked as far down the road as he could. There
was no one in sight, and he started off. A little distance
farther on, the road made a sharp turn and,
just at the angle stood an old barn which hid the
rest of the highway from sight until one was right
at the turn. It was a dangerous place for vehicles,
but the owner of the barn had refused to set it
back.</p>

<p>No sooner had Joe turned this corner than he
came full upon Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Holdney
standing just around the barn, apparently in deep
conversation. At the sight of Joe they looked up
quickly, and Mr. Benjamin exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! Perhaps this lad can tell us. We want
to hire a carriage. Do you know any one around
here who would let us take one for a short time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe, who had started back at the unexpected
sight of the two men, took courage on hearing this,
and realizing that he had not yet been recognized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any one around here,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty much of a stranger myself, but have
you tried at this farmhouse?&rdquo; and he pointed toward
the one where the owner of the barn
lived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t want a farm horse!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Holdney. &ldquo;We want something that has
some speed.&rdquo; Then, as he looked more fully at
Joe he exclaimed: &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I seen you somewhere
before, my lad? I&rsquo;m sure I have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a step toward our hero, and Joe&rsquo;s heart
gave a flutter. He was almost certain that Mr.
Holdney would recognize him and then the next
step would be to ask where he had been. The
men might at once suspect that he had at least
come past the place where they had been talking in
secret, and they might even suspect that he had
listened to them. Joe was in a predicament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve met you somewhere before,&rdquo;
went on Mr. Holdney, in his quick, nervous tones.
&ldquo;Do you live around here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Joe vaguely. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
know where you could get a fast horse unless it&rsquo;s
in town&mdash;in Riverside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was about to pass on, hoping the men would
not further bother him, when Mr. Holdney, coming
a step nearer, said with great firmness:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve seen you before. What&rsquo;s your
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like a flash a way out of it came to Joe, and
that without telling an untruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I play on the Silver Stars,&rdquo; he said quickly.
&ldquo;You may have seen me at some of the games,&rdquo;
which was perfectly possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Holdney. &ldquo;I
knew it was somewhere. Now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into Riverside,&rdquo; went on Joe quickly.
&ldquo;If you like I&rsquo;ll stop at the livery stable and
tell them to send out a rig for you if you want to
wait here for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Benjamin.
&ldquo;Let him do that, Rufus. Here&rsquo;s a quarter to pay
for your trouble, my lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe with a laugh.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to do you a favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented Mr. Benjamin. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ll send out a two-seated carriage and a man to
drive it we&rsquo;ll be obliged to you. Then we can
drive over and see Duncan,&rdquo; he added to Mr.
Holdney. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix this thing all up now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if it&rsquo;s my father you&rsquo;re trying to
&lsquo;fix,&rsquo;&rdquo; mused Joe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best to put a stop
to it. Now, it&rsquo;s up to me to hurry home,&rdquo; and
telling the men that he would do the errand for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
them, the lad hastened off down the road, leaving
the two conspirators in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>The livery stable keeper readily agreed to send
out the carriage, and then Joe lost no time in hurrying
to his house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has father come home yet?&rdquo; he asked of
his mother, for sometimes Mr. Matson came from
the harvester works earlier than the regular stopping
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Matson, &ldquo;why, what is
the matter, Joe? Has anything happened?&rdquo; for
she noticed by his face that something out of the
usual had occurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered slowly. He
was revolving in his mind whether or not he ought
to tell his mother. Then, as he recollected that his
father always consulted her on business matters,
he decided that he would relate his experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t father interested in
some sort of a patent about corn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About corn? Oh, I know what you mean.
Yes, he is working on an improvement to a corn
reaper and binder. It is a machine partly owned
by the harvester people, but he expects to make
considerable money by perfecting the machine. It
is very crude now, and doesn&rsquo;t do good work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if he does perfect it, and some one gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the patents away from him, he <i>won&rsquo;t</i> make the
money!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe, what do you mean?&rdquo; cried his mother
in alarm. &ldquo;I am sure something has happened.
What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, but it may any time,&rdquo;
answered the lad, and then he told of what he had
overheard, and his ideas of what was pending.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I wanted to see father in a hurry,
to warn him,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe, I believe you&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Matson. &ldquo;Your father ought to be told at once.
I don&rsquo;t know what he can do&mdash;if anything&mdash;to
prevent these men getting ahead of him. Oh, it&rsquo;s
too bad! I know he always suspected Mr. Benjamin
of not being strictly honest, but Mr. Holdney
used to be his friend and on several occasions
has loaned your father money. Oh, this is too
bad, but perhaps it isn&rsquo;t too late. If I were you
I&rsquo;d go down toward the harvester works and you
may meet father coming home. Then you can tell
him all about it, and he may want to go back and
get some of his papers, or parts of the machine,
from his office so those men can&rsquo;t take them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing, mother!&rdquo; cried Joe.
&ldquo;You ought to have been a man&mdash;or a boy and a
baseball player! You can think so quickly. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
reminds me; I had quite an experience to-day. Just
say &lsquo;apple sauce&rsquo; to me when I get back, and I&rsquo;ll
tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be possible!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Matson,
when Joe, having met him just outside the harvester
works, told him of what he had heard. &ldquo;It
hardly seems possible that they would do such a
thing. But I&rsquo;m glad you told me, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they meant you, dad? I didn&rsquo;t
hear them mention your name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they meant me!&rdquo; declared Mr.
Matson. &ldquo;The warning came just in time, too,
for only to-day I finished an important part of the
machinery and the pattern of it is in my office now.
I must go back and get it. Wait here for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Joe stood at the outer gate of the big harvester
plant he heard the sound of a carriage approaching,
and turning around he saw Mr. Benjamin
and Mr. Holdney coming along in the rig
Joe had had sent out to them only a little while
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought better to drive back here first, and
go see Duncan later,&rdquo; Mr. Benjamin was saying,
and then both men caught sight of our hero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>A THROWING CONTEST</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Benjamin. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
that same lad again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What lad?&rdquo; quickly demanded Mr. Holdney.
&ldquo;Oh, the one who sent us out this rig. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you want to see any one around the
works?&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Benjamin. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to seem impolite, after the service you rendered,
but we don&rsquo;t allow loiterers here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A number of thoughts passed rapidly through
Joe&rsquo;s mind. He realized that his father might
come out at any moment and be seen by the manager
carrying off the valuable patterns. Mr. Matson
ought to be warned, for Joe realized that if
they were to frustrate the conspiracy it would be
best that the men did not know that they were on
the verge of discovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to take a message to Mr. Matson,&rdquo;
said Joe boldly, for this was the truth. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
quickly formed a plan in his mind, and he hoped
that it would not be discovered that he was Mr.
Matson&rsquo;s son. It was this very trick of quick
thinking that afterward became of so much service
to Joe in his notable career on the diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin.
&ldquo;You may go in. You&rsquo;ll find Mr. Matson in his
office, I dare say.&rdquo; He smiled at Joe in what he
doubtless meant to be a friendly fashion, but the
young baseball player could not help but see the
hypocrisy in it.</p>

<p>Not pausing to exchange any other talk, Joe
slipped in through the big iron gate and made his
way to his father&rsquo;s office. He had been there
before.</p>

<p>Just as he reached it the heavy whistle blew, announcing
closing time, and hundreds of hands began
pouring from the various machine and casting
shops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Joe!&rdquo; called Seth Potter, who played
left field for the Silver Stars. &ldquo;What you doing
here, looking for a job?&rdquo; Seth was employed in
one of the offices, and was considered a valuable
young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want to learn how to make a machine
so I don&rsquo;t miss any flies that come my way,&rdquo;
laughed Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Going to play with us Saturday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; and then, with a few other pleasant
words, Seth hurried on, and Joe sought his
father. He found Mr. Matson wrapping up some
models.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick dad!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Mr. Benjamin
and Mr. Holdney are out at the gate. They just
drove up. I slipped in to warn you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good, Joe! I&rsquo;m glad you did. I wouldn&rsquo;t
want them to see me taking these things away, for
it would tell them that their game was discovered,
and I want to find out more of what their plans
are before they are aware of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how you going to get out?&rdquo; asked his
son. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re there yet,&rdquo; he added, for he could
look from a window and see the carriage still at
the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you and I can slip out the back way. It&rsquo;s
lucky you told me. There, I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; and having
locked his desk, Mr. Matson took his package and
with Joe went out of a rear exit, going home by
a roundabout way so that the conspirators did not
see them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! I wish this thing hadn&rsquo;t happened, or
that it was postponed for a while,&rdquo; said Mr. Matson
thoughtfully as he walked along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is it likely to be serious, dad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. You see I have a peculiar arrangement
with the harvester concern in regard to
things that I might invent. It is too complicated
to go into all the details, but I have to trust to
their honor to give me my rights in certain matters.
If they wanted to they could deprive me of the
benefits of my patents and the law could not help
me. So I have to be very careful. Up to now I
have trusted Mr. Benjamin implicitly, but now&mdash;now
I will be on my guard. It is a lucky thing
you overheard that talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an earnest consultation between Mr.
and Mrs. Matson that night, to which Joe and his
sister were not admitted, for it was business they
would not have understood. But at the close they
were told to say nothing of what had happened
that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will keep right on at the harvester works
as if nothing had occurred,&rdquo; said Mr. Matson,
&ldquo;and then they will not get suspicious. But I will
do the most important and secret work on my invention
here at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that it is all settled,&rdquo; said Clara, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to say &lsquo;apple sauce&rsquo; to you, Joe. What
does it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; and the young baseball player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
laughed. &ldquo;Well I guess you&rsquo;ve got to join the
Dorcas and Sewing societies, mother, to keep me
out of a scrape,&rdquo; and with many funny touches Joe
told about his wild throw that day, making an
amusing story of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would have given anything if some of
the girls and I could have been there when you
and Tom were blacking the stove!&rdquo; exclaimed
Clara with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Joe, &ldquo;though
it&rsquo;s lucky we didn&rsquo;t have to mop up the floor.
After this I&rsquo;m going to go a mile away from her
house when I want to practice throwing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you would,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Matson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll join those societies; won&rsquo;t you
mother?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to, in order to keep
you out of prison,&rdquo; she agreed with a laugh. &ldquo;But
please don&rsquo;t make any more engagements for me,
as my time is pretty well occupied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was two days after this when Tom Davis,
coming out of school, caught up with Joe who was
a little in advance of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got anything special to do?&rdquo; asked the substitute
first baseman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, why?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe you&rsquo;d like to go out in the
lot again, and have some more practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back of Mrs. Peterkin&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; asked Joe
with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say not! But I&rsquo;ve got a new scheme.
I read about it in that baseball book. We&rsquo;ll have
a contest for long distance throwing and accuracy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why you and I&rsquo;ll go down in the same lots
but we&rsquo;ll throw in the other direction. Then we
can&rsquo;t hit anything. We&rsquo;ll see who can throw the
farthest. You&rsquo;ll need to practice that if you are
to play centre field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the other contest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For straight aim. I&rsquo;ll get an old basket, and
we&rsquo;ll see who can land the most balls in it. Want
to try?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Anything to improve myself,&rdquo; said Joe
earnestly.</p>

<p>A little later he and his chum were on their way
to the vacant lots. As they walked along they met
several other lads, some of whom played on the
regular team, a few from the High School nine,
and some from the Silver Star scrub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; demanded Rodney Burke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to see who is the best thrower,&rdquo;
answered Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a show at it?&rdquo; requested Ford Wilson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; assented Joe. &ldquo;The more, the merrier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon a jolly crowd of youngsters were taking
turns at the long distance throwing. After several
tries the record lay between Joe and Rodney
Burke, and they played off a tie, Joe winning by
about seven feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good throw all right,&rdquo; complimented
the loser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fellow who&rsquo;s playing centre field needs to
have a pretty good heave,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Especially
if he&rsquo;s up against a heavy-hitting team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s been our luck for some time past,&rdquo;
spoke Tom. &ldquo;Well, now for the basket test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was more difficult than straight throwing
for distance and several of the lads dropped out,
being disqualified by failures. But Tom, Joe and
Rodney remained in, and for a time it was pretty
even between them. Finally it narrowed down to
Tom and Joe, and they were just ready to throw
the deciding round when a new voice called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any objections to me joining?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe and the others turned, to see the half-mocking
face of Sam Morton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>ANOTHER DEFEAT</h3>


<p>For a moment there was some embarrassment,
as Sam was not in the habit of mingling with this
crowd of boys. He had his own friends, not
very many, to tell the truth, but he was usually
with them. The lads did not know exactly how
to take his request, but Joe came to the rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure you can come in,&rdquo; he said heartily.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just seeing who can put the most balls in
the basket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good do you think that does?&rdquo; asked
Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, doesn&rsquo;t it help a fellow to get a straight
aim?&rdquo; asked Tom, half defiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the rather sneering
answer. &ldquo;It might, if you kept at it long enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see you try it,&rdquo; suggested Rodney Burke,
who did not hold Sam in much awe.</p>

<p>Carelessly the Silver Star pitcher accepted a
ball that Joe obligingly held out. He threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
quickly and the ball landed squarely in the basket.
Then he did the trick again, and there was a little
murmur of applause, for only a few of the boys
had &ldquo;two straight&rdquo; to their credit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe did three straight a while ago,&rdquo; said Tom
proudly. &ldquo;He and I are playing off a tie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam did not answer but threw again, and the
ball went wide of the basket by two feet at least.
Rodney laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not such a much, even if you are the
pitcher,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who asked you anything about it?&rdquo; demanded
Sam savagely.</p>

<p>He darted a look of anger at the lad, but as
Rodney was well built and had a reputation for
&ldquo;scrappiness&rdquo; Sam concluded not to tackle him
just then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you how to throw!&rdquo; he exclaimed
the next moment, and two balls went squarely in
the basket. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see you and Matson play
it off,&rdquo; commanded Sam to Tom as though he was
in the habit of having his wishes complied with.</p>

<p>Whether it was nervousness or not, or whether
he wanted to see his chum do well when Sam was
present, was not made manifest, but Tom did not
come up to his previous record, and Joe easily won.
In fact Joe made a much better score than Sam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and there were several curious glances directed at
the pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to try it some more?&rdquo; asked
Rodney Burke, and there was mockery in his
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; half-growled Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to save
my arm for the next game. We&rsquo;re going to win
that sure. So long,&rdquo; and with that he turned and
strode away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As cheerful as a bear with a sore nose,&rdquo; remarked
Rodney.</p>

<p>Ordinarily but little importance would have been
attached to the coming game with the Denville
Whizzers, but on account of two previous defeats,
Darrell Blackney and George Rankin had several
conferences concerning it. The captain and manager
were plainly worried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish you had some one else to put in
the box?&rdquo; asked Rankin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t lost faith in Sam, but I do wish we could
depend more on him. He&rsquo;ll pitch fine for several
innings and then go to pieces. He tries to use
too much speed and too many varieties of curves,
I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, what do you think of young
Matson?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a good deal of him. He doesn&rsquo;t
amount to much as yet, but he&rsquo;s in earnest and he&rsquo;s
got grit. In time I think he&rsquo;ll make a player.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants to pitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know he does, but it&rsquo;s out of the question
yet. Have you any line on him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; answered Rankin, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll keep
my eyes open. He&rsquo;s a good fielder all right, now
that he isn&rsquo;t so nervous. He wants to play his
head off. But Sam&mdash;well, we can&rsquo;t do any better
right away, and&mdash;well, I guess we&rsquo;ll win this
game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to!&rdquo; insisted the manager earnestly,
&ldquo;if we want the people of Riverside to support
us. They won&rsquo;t come to see a losing home team
all the while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The game with the Whizzers was to take place
on their grounds, and early on that morning the
Silver Stars, some substitutes, and a crowd of
&ldquo;rooters&rdquo; got ready for the trip. Denville was
about seven miles from Riverside, back from the
stream, and could be reached by trolley. A special
car had been engaged for the team.</p>

<p>The game started off well, and the Silver Stars
got three runs in their half of the first inning.
The home team was blanked and for a time it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
looked as if there would be an easy victory for
the visitors.</p>

<p>Sam was pitching in good form, and had struck
several men out. For three innings the home
team did not get a run, and there was only one to
their credit in the fourth. There was gloom and
despair among their supporters while the &ldquo;rooters&rdquo;
of the visiting team were happy singing
songs and yelling.</p>

<p>Joe played well and had two outs to his credit
on long flies, with no errors to mar his record.
But he noticed that as the home team came to the
bat in their half of the fifth, in which the Silver
Stars had made two runs, that Darrell and the
captain were in earnest consultation with Sam.
They seemed to be remonstrating with him, and
Joe heard the manager say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it easy now; we have the game on ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know how to play ball,&rdquo; retorted the
pitcher.</p>

<p>Then began a series of happenings. With a
lead of four runs when the last half of the fifth
started it would have seemed that the Stars might
have won out. But Sam fell a prey to the applause
of the crowd and began to do &ldquo;grandstand&rdquo;
work. He contorted his body unnecessarily
in winding up for a delivery. He hopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
about before pitching the ball and he failed to
study the batters, though he had had plenty of
chance to do so.</p>

<p>The result was that he went to pieces through
sheer weariness and began giving balls. Then the
home team, realizing what was happening, began
to pound him, and to steal bases. In their half of
the fifth the home team made six runs, putting
them two ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to stop that!&rdquo; said Darrell, with
a shake of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sure have,&rdquo; agreed the captain.</p>

<p>There was somewhat of a brace on the part of
the Stars and they made one run in their part of
the sixth. But the Whizzers kept pace with them.
The seventh inning resulted in one run for the
visitors and none for the home team and that
made only a lead of one for the home nine.</p>

<p>Joe brought in a run in the eighth, but as if it
had been prearranged the home team duplicated
so the score at the beginning of the ninth stood
eight to nine in favor of the home team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need two runs to win, if we can serve
them goose eggs for lunch,&rdquo; said the Silver Star
captain grimly. &ldquo;Go to it, boys; beat &rsquo;em
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we will,&rdquo; said Sam airily, and he brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in one of the needed two runs. Darrell contributed
the other, and when the visiting team took
the field they were one ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let a man get to first!&rdquo; cried Captain
Rankin.</p>

<p>But it was not to be. Sam gave the first man
his base on balls and there was a groan of anguish
from his fellows and the Riverside crowd. Then
the second man whacked out what appeared to be
a pretty three bagger, scoring the runner from
first. The batter slipped on his way from second
to third, however, and was put out when Joe
made a magnificent throw in from deep centre.</p>

<p>With one out Sam gathered himself together
and struck out the next man. Then came to the
bat the mightiest walloper of the rival team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait for a good one. Make him give you
what you want,&rdquo; advised the coacher to the
batter.</p>

<p>And the latter did wait, for when he got what
he wanted he &ldquo;slammed it&rdquo; away out in centre
field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A home run! A home run!&rdquo; yelled the frantic
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And win the game!&rdquo; shouted a score of the
players&rsquo; friends. &ldquo;Come on, baby-mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe was madly racing after the ball, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
gone away beyond him. He got it and hurled it
to second for a relay home, as a quick glance had
shown him the man rounding third.</p>

<p>Straight and true the ball went and the baseman
had it. Then he sent it to Catcher Ferguson
as the runner was racing in. Sam had run from
his box and stood watching and expectant near
home plate.</p>

<p>The runner dropped and slid and Bart Ferguson,
as the ball landed in his mitt, reached over to
touch him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; howled the umpire, and it meant the
defeat of the Silver Stars.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence and then Sam,
stepping up to the umpire, a lad smaller than himself,
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe, eh? Not in a thousand years! You
don&rsquo;t know how to umpire a game. Safe! I
guess not!&rdquo; and drawing back his fist Sam sent it
crashing into the face of the other lad.</p>

<h3>JOE IS WATCHED</h3>


<p>There was an uproar in an instant. Players
started for Sam and the unoffending lad whom he
had struck. There were savage yells, calling for
vengeance. Even Sam&rsquo;s mates, used as they were
to his fits of temper, were not prepared for this.
The Whizzer players were wild to get at him, but,
instinctively Darrell, Joe, Rankin, and some of the
others of the Silver Stars formed a protecting
cordon about their pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you crazy, Sam? What in the world did
you do that for?&rdquo; demanded the manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He made a rank decision, an unfair one!&rdquo;
cried Sam, &ldquo;and when I called him down he was
going to hit me. I got in ahead of him&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so!&rdquo; cried the Whizzer captain.
&ldquo;I saw it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; chimed in some of his mates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farson never raised his hand to him!&rdquo; declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
another lad, who had been standing near
the umpire. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a big coward to hit a chap
smaller than you are!&rdquo; he called tauntingly to
Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not afraid to hit you!&rdquo; cried the
pitcher, who seemed to have lost control of himself.
&ldquo;And if you want anything you know how
to get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;m willing to take it right now,&rdquo;
yelled the other, stepping up to Sam.</p>

<p>There might have been another fight then and
there, for both lads were unreasonable with anger,
but Darrell quickly stepped in between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; burst out the Stars&rsquo; manager,
in what he tried to make a good-natured and reasoning
voice, &ldquo;this has got to stop. We didn&rsquo;t
come here to fight, we came to play baseball and
you trimmed us properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you fellows take your medicine?&rdquo;
demanded the home captain. &ldquo;What
right has he got to tackle our umpire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No right at all,&rdquo; admitted Darrell. &ldquo;Sam
was in the wrong and he&rsquo;ll apologize. He probably
thought the man was out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he <i>was</i> out!&rdquo; exploded the unreasonable
pitcher. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not apologize, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wipe up the field with &rsquo;em!&rdquo; came in murmurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
from the home players. Several of the lads
had grasped their bats.</p>

<p>It was a critical moment and Darrell felt it.
He pulled Sam to one side and whispered rapidly
and tensely in his ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam, you&rsquo;ve got to apologize, and you&rsquo;ve got
to admit that the runner was safe. There&rsquo;s no
other way out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was defiance in Sam&rsquo;s air. Darrell took
a quick decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll put you out of the team!&rdquo; was his
instant rejoinder, and it came so promptly that
Sam winced.</p>

<p>Now it is one thing to resign, but quite another
to be read out of an organization, whether it be
a baseball team or a political society. Sam realized
this. He might have, in his anger, refused
to belong to the Silver Stars and, later on he could
boast of having gotten out of his own accord.
But to be &ldquo;fired&rdquo; carried no glory with it, and
Sam was ever on the lookout for glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that?&rdquo; he asked of Darrell.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you fellows stick up for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked a vain appeal to his mates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean every word of it,&rdquo; replied the manager
firmly. &ldquo;We fellows would stick up for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
if you were in the right, but you&rsquo;re dead wrong
this time. It&rsquo;s apologize or get out of the team!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more Sam paused. He could hear the
angry murmurs of the home players as they
watched him, waiting for his decision. Even some
of his own mates were regarding him with unfriendly
eyes. He must make a virtue of necessity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;I&mdash;I apologize,&rdquo; said Sam in a
low voice. &ldquo;The runner was safe I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be sure about it,&rdquo; said the captain
of the Whizzers, in a peculiar tone as he
looked at Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re sorry you hit our umpire?&rdquo; persisted
the captain, for Sam&rsquo;s apology had not been
very satisfactory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You needn&rsquo;t rub it in,&rdquo; growled the
pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you shake hands with him,
and tell him so like a man?&rdquo; went on the home
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t shake hands with him!&rdquo; exclaimed
the small umpire. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t shake hands with
cowards!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was another murmur, and the trouble
that had been so nearly adjusted threatened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
break out again. But Darrell was wise in his
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; he called, more cheerily
than he felt. &ldquo;You fellows beat us fairly and on
the level. We haven&rsquo;t a kick coming, but we may
treat you to a dose of the same medicine when we
have a return game; eh, old man?&rdquo; and he made
his way to the opposing captain and the manager
and cordially shook hands with them. There was
a half cheer from the Whizzers. They liked a
good loser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, maybe you can turn the tables on us,&rdquo;
admitted the other manager, &ldquo;but I hope when
we do come to Riverside you&rsquo;ll have a different
pitcher,&rdquo; and he glanced significantly at Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No telling,&rdquo; replied Darrell with a laugh.
&ldquo;Come on, fellows. We&rsquo;ll give three cheers for
the team that beat us and then we&rsquo;ll beat it for
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was rather a silent crowd of the Silver Stars
that rode in the special trolley. Following them
was another car containing some of the &ldquo;rooters.&rdquo;
They made up in liveliness what the team
members lacked in spirits, for there were a number
of girls with the lads, Joe&rsquo;s sister and Tom&rsquo;s
being among them, and they started some school
songs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>
<p>And the gloom that seemed to hang over the
Stars was not altogether because of their defeat.
It was the remembrance of Sam&rsquo;s unsportsmanlike
act, and it rankled deep.</p>

<p>On his part it is doubtful if Sam felt any remorse.
He was a hot-tempered lad, used to having
his own way, and probably he thought he had
done just right in chastising the umpire for what
he regarded as a rank decision.</p>

<p>Darrell, Rankin and some of the others tried to
be jolly and start a line of talk that would make
the lads forget the unpleasant incident, but it is
doubtful if they succeeded to any great extent.</p>

<p>The manager was seriously considering the
future of the team. Was it wise to go on with
such a pitcher as Sam who, though talented, could
not be relied upon and who was likely to make
&ldquo;breaks&rdquo; at unexpected times?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet what can we do?&rdquo; asked Darrell of the
captain. &ldquo;Is there another man we could put in
or get from some other team?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any other team would part
with a good pitcher at this time of the season,&rdquo;
replied Rankin. &ldquo;Surely not if he was a real
good one, and we want one that <i>is</i> good. As
for using some of the other fellows in Sam&rsquo;s place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
I don&rsquo;t know of any one that&rsquo;s anywhere near as
good as he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about Percy Parnell? He&rsquo;s pitched
some, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you know what happened. He was
knocked out of the box and we were whitewashed
that game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; exclaimed Darrell. &ldquo;I just happened
to think of it. That new fellow&mdash;Joe Matson.
He told me he used to pitch in his home town&mdash;Bentville
I think it was. I wonder if he&rsquo;d be any
good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard telling,&rdquo; replied the captain, somewhat
indifferently. &ldquo;We ought to do something, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what I&rsquo;m going to do,&rdquo; went on
Darrell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to write to some one in
Bentville. I think I know an old baseball friend
there, and I&rsquo;ll ask him what Matson&rsquo;s record was.
If he made good at all we might give him a tryout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have Sam get on his ear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether he does or not. Things
can&rsquo;t be much worse; can they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I guess not. Go ahead. I&rsquo;m with you
in anything you do. Three straight wallops in
three weeks have taken the heart out of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here. Well, we&rsquo;ll see what we can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe reached home that night rather tired and
discouraged. He felt the defeat of his team keenly,
and the more so as the nine he had played with
in Bentville had had a much better record than
that of the Silver Stars&mdash;at least so far, though
the Silver Stars were an older and stronger
team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;m the hoodoo?&rdquo; mused Joe.
&ldquo;They lost the first game I saw them play, and
the next one I played in they lost, and here&rsquo;s this
one. I hope I&rsquo;m not a jinx.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he reviewed his own playing in the two
games where he had had a chance to show what he
could do, and he had no fault to find with his
efforts. True, he had made errors; but who had
not?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to keep on practicing,&rdquo; mused Joe.
&ldquo;If I can work up in speed and accuracy, and
keep what curving power I have already, I may
get a chance to pitch. Things are coming to a
head with Sam, and, though I don&rsquo;t wish him any
bad luck, if he <i>does</i> get out I hope I get a chance
to go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Following this plan, Joe went off by himself one
afternoon several days later to practice throwing
in the empty lot. He used a basket to hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
balls he pitched and he was glad to find that he
had not gone back any from the time when he
and Tom, with the other lads, had had their contest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can only keep this up,&rdquo; mused the lad,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get there some day. Jove! If ever I should
become one of the big league players! Think of
taking part in the World&rsquo;s series! Cracky! I&rsquo;d
rather be in the box, facing the champions, than
to be almost anything else I can think of. Forty
thousand people watching you as you wind up and
send in a swift one like this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that Joe let fly a ball with all his
speed toward the basket. He was not so much intent
on accuracy then as he was in letting off some
surplus &ldquo;steam,&rdquo; and he was not a little surprised
when the ball not only went <i>into</i> the basket
but <i>through</i> it, ripping out the bottom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m throwing
faster than I thought I was. That basket is on
the fritz. But if I&rsquo;d been sending a ball over the
plate it would have had some speed back of it,
and it would have gone to the right spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Joe went to pick up the ball and examine the
broken basket more closely a figure peered out
from a little clump of trees on the edge of the
field where the lad was practicing. The figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
watched the would-be pitcher closely and then
murmured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He certainly has <i>speed</i> all right. I&rsquo;d like to
be back of the plate and watch him throw them
in. I wonder if he has anything in him after all?
It&rsquo;s worth taking a chance on. I&rsquo;ll wait a bit
longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The figure dodged behind the trees again as
Joe once more took his position. He had stuffed
some grass in the hole in the peach basket he was
using, and again he threw in it.</p>

<p>He was just as accurate as before, and, now
and then, when he cut loose, he sent the ball with
unerring aim and with great force into the receptacle,
several times knocking it down off the stake
on which it was fastened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as there&rsquo;s much use in writing
to Bentville to find out about him,&rdquo; mused the
figure hidden by the trees. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s got that
speed, and continues to show the control he has
to-day, even without any curves he&rsquo;d be a help to
us. I&rsquo;m going to speak to Rankin about it,&rdquo; and
with that the figure turned away.</p>

<p>Had Joe looked he would have seen Darrell
Blackney, manager of the Silver Stars, who had
been playing the innocent spy on him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>&ldquo;WOULD YOU LIKE TO PITCH?&rdquo;</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Come now, fellows, let&rsquo;s get into practice.
Are all the scrub here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darrell Blackney looked around over the
diamond, where about twenty lads were assembled
one fine afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the scrub, but all our fellows
are on hand,&rdquo; replied Rankin. &ldquo;Is it all
arranged about the game Saturday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re to play the Fayetteville Academy
lads on their grounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A trip out of town, eh? That&rsquo;s two in two
weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well it gives our fellows experience in playing
on some other diamond than their own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t much matter. The Fayettevilles
will be easy fruit for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure. They&rsquo;re a younger team,
that&rsquo;s true, and they haven&rsquo;t been doing well this
season, but neither have we of late.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll beat &rsquo;em,&rdquo; declared the captain confidently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so myself, but I don&rsquo;t want you to
take too many chances. Here comes Sam. You
and he get in for some warm-up work, Bart, and
I&rsquo;ll get the scrub together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darrell went about the diamond, calling to the
various members of the &ldquo;scrub,&rdquo; or second
team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t any pitcher,&rdquo; remarked Blake
Carrington, who acted as captain of the scrub organization.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Slater?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t showed up, and none of the other
fellows feel like getting in the box against you
boys. You&rsquo;ll have to find us a pitcher before we
can play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden idea came to Darrell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I guess I can.
Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran over to where Rankin was talking to
some of his players.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you play Tom Davis in centre field for
to-day?&rdquo; asked the manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess so. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have Joe Matson pitch on the
scrub. It will be a good time to get a line on him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and I&rsquo;ll see if he shapes up as well as the day he
did when I watched him practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; maybe it will be a good idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe hardly knew what to say when Darrell, as
calmly as if he had done it several times before,
asked him to go in the box for the scrub and pitch
against the Silver Stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do your best,&rdquo; added Darrell. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care how many of our fellows you strike out.
Every one, if you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s heart gave a bound of delight. It might
be the beginning of the very chance he had been
waiting for so long. He calmed himself with an
effort for he did not want to get &ldquo;rattled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he answered as though he had
been used to such sudden emergency calls all season.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do. I&rsquo;d like a chance
to warm up, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. You and Jake Bender go over there
and practice for five minutes. Then we&rsquo;ll play a
five-inning game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Stars were to bat first, and there was a
mocking smile on the face of Sam Morton as he
watched his rival go to the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t strike us all out,&rdquo; called Sam. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
had hard luck enough lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The game began, and it was for &ldquo;blood&rdquo; from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the very start. Joe was a trifle nervous, especially
when he had two balls called on his first two efforts.
Then he braced himself, and, not trying
for speed, sent in a slow, easy ball that completely
fooled the batter, who eventually struck out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty good for a starter,&rdquo; complimented
Darrell. Sam Morton scowled.</p>

<p>The next batter hit an easy fly which was so
promptly gathered in by the shortstop that there
was little use in the player starting for first. Then
Joe struck out the next lad after he had hit a
couple of fouls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried Tom Davis, as he
patted his chum on the back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be in the
box for the Stars yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get me all excited,&rdquo; begged Joe with a
smile. Yet he could not help feeling elated.</p>

<p>There was a viciousness in the pitching of Sam
when he toed the plate that showed how his feelings
had been stirred. He was evidently going to
show how much superior he was.</p>

<p>He did strike out two men, and then came Joe&rsquo;s
turn at the bat. Our hero thought he detected a
gleam of anger in Sam&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d just as soon hit me with a ball as not,&rdquo;
thought Joe, &ldquo;and if he does it will hurt some.
And he may be trying to bluff me so that I won&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
stand up to the plate. I&rsquo;ll see what I can do to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Consequently, instead of waiting for the ball to
get to him Joe stepped up and out to meet it before
the curve &ldquo;broke.&rdquo; He &ldquo;walked right into it,&rdquo;
as the baseball term has it, and the result was that
he whacked out a pretty two-bagger that brought
his mates to their feet with yells. Sam bit his lips
in anger, but he kept his temper by an effort and
struck out the next man so that Joe&rsquo;s effort resulted
in nothing.</p>

<p>The game went on, and when Sam at bat faced
Joe, our hero could not help feeling a trifle nervous.
He had sized up Sam&rsquo;s style of batting,
however, and was prepared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give him a slow ball with an in-shoot
to it,&rdquo; decided Joe. &ldquo;He keeps back from
the plate and this will make him get still farther
back. I&rsquo;m going to strike him out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And strike him out Joe did, though not until
after Sam had hit one foul that was within a shade
of being fair. But when on his next two strikes
he fanned the wind, there was a look of wonder
and gratification on the face of Darrell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe Joe is going to make good,&rdquo; he said
to Rankin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure looks so. What about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see in a minute. I&rsquo;m going to give him
a chance to pitch part of the game against the
Fayetteville Academy nine&mdash;that is if you agree
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, go as far as you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the close of the game, which was won by
the Stars, though by a small margin, Darrell approached
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the new pitcher diffidently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did first rate. How would you like to
pitch part of the game Saturday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo; was the eager question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I&rsquo;ll put you in for a few innings
toward the end, after we&rsquo;ve cinched it, for I think
it will be easy for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not the highest honor that could have
come to Joe, but he realized what it meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it immensely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but won&rsquo;t
Sam&mdash;what about him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care anything about him,&rdquo; said Darrell
quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running this team. Will you
pitch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sure will!&rdquo; and Joe&rsquo;s heart beat high with
hope.</p>

<h3>TO THE RESCUE</h3>


<p>Joe Matson felt as though he was walking in
the air when he went home that afternoon following
the scrub game. That his ambition was about
to be realized, and so soon after joining the team,
was almost unbelievable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Joe?&rdquo; asked Clara,
as her brother fairly pranced into the house,
caught her around the waist and swung her in the
start of a waltz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter? Plenty&rsquo;s the matter! I&rsquo;m going to
pitch on the Stars Saturday. Hurray!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! Any one would think you were going
to pitch up <i>to</i> the stars the way you&rsquo;re going on.
Let go of me; you&rsquo;ll have my hair all mussed up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easily fixed. Yes, I&rsquo;m going to pitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Fayetteville Academy, on their grounds.
It won&rsquo;t be much of a game, and I&rsquo;m not to go in
until it&rsquo;s in the ice box&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the ice box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the refrigerator you know&mdash;safe. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
I&rsquo;m to try my hand at putting &rsquo;em over. Of course
I&rsquo;d like to go the whole nine innings but I can&rsquo;t
have everything at the start. It&rsquo;s mighty decent
of Darrell to give me this chance. Aren&rsquo;t you
glad, sis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I am. I&rsquo;d like to see the game,
but I&rsquo;ve used up all of my allowance for this week,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; and Joe held out a dollar. &ldquo;Blow
yourself, sis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what horrid slang!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean go to the game on me. I&rsquo;ll stand
treat. Take a girl if you want to and see yours
truly do himself proud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe hunted up his mother to tell her the good
news. He found her in the room which his father
had fitted up as a workshop since the suspicious
actions of Mr. Benjamin at the harvester factory.
Mrs. Matson was looking over some
papers, and there was on her face the same worried
look Joe had seen there before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has anything happened, mother?&rdquo; he asked
quickly, his own good news fading away as he
thought of the trouble that might menace his
father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, only the same trouble about the patent,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;There is nothing new, but your father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
thinks from the recent actions of Mr. Benjamin
that the manager suspects something. Your
father is getting some papers ready to go to
Washington, and I was looking them over for him.
I used to work in a lawyer&rsquo;s office when I was a
girl,&rdquo; she went on with a smile, &ldquo;and I know a
little about the patent business so I thought I
would help your father if I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nothing wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, and if all goes right he will soon
have his patent granted, and then those men can
not harm him. But you look as though you had
good news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; and the lad fairly bubbled over in
telling his mother of the chance that had so unexpectedly
come to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Matson was quite enthusiastic about Joe&rsquo;s
chance when he came home from work, and together
they talked about it after supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could go see the game,&rdquo; said Mr.
Matson, &ldquo;but I am too busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is the patent coming on?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, pretty good. Thanks to you I was
warned in time. If I had left my drawings, patterns
and other things in the shop I&rsquo;m afraid it
wouldn&rsquo;t be going so well. Mr. Benjamin evidently
suspects something. Only to-day he asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
me how I was coming on with it, and he wanted to
know why I wasn&rsquo;t working on it any more. I had
to put him off with some excuse and he acted very
queer. Right after that I heard him calling up
Mr. Holdney on the telephone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your worry will be over when your application
is allowed,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Matson.</p>

<p>Joe went to his baseball practice with a vim in
the days that intervened before the game that
was to be so important to him. Tom Davis
helped him, and several times cautioned his chum
about overdoing himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your arm gets stiff&mdash;it&rsquo;s good-night for
you,&rdquo; he declared, in his usual blunt way.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to take care of yourself, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but I want to get up more speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Speed isn&rsquo;t everything.
Practice for control, and that won&rsquo;t be so hard on
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, as the days went on, Joe realized that he
was perfecting himself, though he still had much
to learn about the great game.</p>

<p>It was the day before the contest when our hero
was to occupy the box for the first time for the
Stars. He and Tom had practiced hard and Joe
knew that he was &ldquo;fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe wondered how Sam Morton had taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
news of his rival&rsquo;s advance, but if Sam knew he
said nothing about it, and in the practice with the
scrub he was unusually friendly to Joe. For Darrell
decided not to have the new pitcher go into the
box for the Stars until the last moment. He did
not want word of it to get out, and Joe and the
catcher did some practice in private with signals.</p>

<p>The last practice had been held on the afternoon
prior to the game, and arrangements completed
for the team going to Fayetteville. Joe
was on his way home on a car with Tom Davis,
for Riverside boasted of a trolley system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; asked Tom of his chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine as a fiddle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your arm isn&rsquo;t lame or sore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, I can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe was interrupted by a cry from two ladies
who sat in front of them, the only other occupants
of the vehicle save themselves. The car was going
down hill and had acquired considerable speed&mdash;dangerous
speed Joe thought&mdash;and the motorman
did not seem to have it well under control.</p>

<p>But what had caused the cry of alarm was this.
Driving along the street, parallel with the tracks,
and about three hundred feet ahead of the car, was
a boy in an open delivery wagon. He was going
in the same direction as was the electric vehicle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p>Suddenly his horse stumbled and fell almost
on the tracks, the wagon sliding half over the
animal while the boy on the seat was hemmed in
and pinned down by a number of boxes and baskets
that slid forward from the rear of the wagon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put on your brakes! Put on your brakes!&rdquo;
yelled the conductor to the motorman. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
run him down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The motorman ground at the handle, and the
brake shoes whined as they gripped the wheels,
but the car came nearer and nearer the wagon.
The conductor on the rear platform was also putting
on the brakes there.</p>

<p>Suddenly the horse kicked himself around so
that he was free of the tracks, lying alongside
them, and far enough to one side so that the car
would safely pass him. There was a sigh of relief
from the two women passengers, but a moment
later it changed to a cry of alarm, for the boy
on the seat suddenly fell to one side, and hung
there with his head so far over that the car would
hit him as it rushed past. The lad was evidently
pinned down by the boxes and baskets on his legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop the car!&rdquo; begged one of the ladies.
The other had covered her eyes with her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the motorman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got
too much speed! I can&rsquo;t stop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>Joe sprang to his feet and made his way along
the seat past Tom, to the running board of the
car, for the vehicle was an open one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To save that lad! He&rsquo;ll be killed if the car
strikes him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the motorman do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s grinding on the brakes as
hard as he can and so is the conductor. I&rsquo;ve got
to save him&mdash;these ladies can&rsquo;t! I can lean over
and pull him aboard the car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your arm! You&rsquo;ll strain your arm and
you can&rsquo;t pitch to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an instant Joe hesitated, but only for an
instant. He realized that what Tom said was
true. He saw a vision of himself sitting idly on
the bench, unable to twirl the ball because of a
sprained arm. Then Joe made up his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to save him!&rdquo; he cried as he hurried
to the front end of the running board. Then,
clinging to the upright of the car with his left arm,
he stretched out his other to save the lad from
almost certain death, the conductor and motorman
unable to lend aid and the women incapable.
There was not room on the running board for
Tom to help Joe.</p>

<h3>A DELAYED PITCHER</h3>


<p>The motorman was grinding away at the
brakes but the heavy car continued to slide on, for
the hill was steep. The horse lay quiet now, for a
man had managed to get to him and sit on his
head, so the animal could not kick and thresh
about with the consequent danger of getting his
legs under the trolley. The car would pass the
horse and the wagon by a good margin, but the
boy, leaning far over, was sure to be hit unless
Joe saved him, and no one in the street seemed to
think of the boy&rsquo;s danger. He said later that he
did not realize it himself.</p>

<p>The lad was struggling to free himself but
could not, and he did not seem to be able to raise
himself to an upright position on the seat, in which
case he would have been safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady now!&rdquo; called Joe, and he braced himself
for the shock he knew would come.</p>

<p>The next instant, as the car kept on, Joe found
himself opposite the lad and reaching forward his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
right hand he grasped him by the collar, shoving
him away so the car would not strike him. Then,
holding on in grim despair Joe pulled the youth
toward him, aided by the momentum of the
vehicle. His idea was to get him aboard the car
to prevent his being struck by it, and in this he
succeeded.</p>

<p>There was a ripping sound, for some part of
the lad&rsquo;s clothing was caught on the seat and tore
loose. A shower of boxes and baskets followed
the body as it slid forward, and a moment later
Joe had the lad on the foot board beside him, safe
and sound, but very much astonished by his sudden
descent from the wagon seat.</p>

<p>Joe felt an excruciating pain shoot through his
arm&mdash;his pitching arm. It was numb from the
shock but even yet he did not dare let go, for the
lad was on uncertain footing. The pain increased.
It was like being kicked by the back-fire of an
auto or motor boat. For a moment there was a
dull sensation and then the outraged nerves and
muscles seemed to cry out in agony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there!&rdquo; murmured Joe between his
clenched teeth to the lad he had saved. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
all right I guess. Will&mdash;will somebody&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not finish, but turned to the conductor,
who had rushed toward him on the running board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
ready to relieve him of the lad&rsquo;s weight. But the
boy was able to look after himself now, for the
vehicle was almost at a standstill, and the motorman
had it under control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much&mdash;much obliged to you,&rdquo; the boy stammered
his thanks to Joe who was slowly making
his way back to where Tom awaited him. Joe did
not know whether he could get there or not, passing
himself along by clinging with his left hand to
the successive car uprights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He saved your life all right,&rdquo; said the conductor,
who had hold of the delivery wagon lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; chimed in several other men
from the street, as they crowded up around the
car.</p>

<p>By this time the motorman had succeeded in
bringing the vehicle to a full stop and Joe, fearing
he might fall, for the pain was very severe, got
off. Tom hurried up to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did it strain you much?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little&mdash;yes; considerable I guess,&rdquo; admitted
Joe, making a wry face. &ldquo;But it will be all right&mdash;I
guess.&rdquo; His right arm&mdash;the arm he hoped
to use in the game on the morrow&mdash;the first game
with him in the box&mdash;hung limp at his side.</p>

<p>Tom Davis saw and knew at once that something
serious was the matter. He realized what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
it meant to Joe, and he lost no time in useless talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come with me!&rdquo; he commanded, taking
hold of Joe&rsquo;s left arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; demanded our hero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To our old family doctor. That arm of yours
will need attention if you&rsquo;re going to pitch to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I can pitch, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes you can&mdash;you&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to. Dr. Pickett will
give you something to fix it up. You can&rsquo;t let this
chance slip. I was afraid this would happen when
I saw what you were going to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe simply, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t let him
be hit by the car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not, and yet&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ll see
what Dr. Pickett says. Come on,&rdquo; and Tom
quickly improvised a sling from his own and Joe&rsquo;s
handkerchiefs, and was about to lead his chum
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you hurt? I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; exclaimed
the lad whom Joe had saved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a strain,&rdquo; said the pitcher, but he did
not add what it might mean to him.</p>

<p>The lad thanked Joe again, earnestly, for his
brave act and then hastened to look after his
horse, that had been gotten to its feet. The
motorman, too, thanked Joe for, though had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
accident resulted it would not have been his fault,
yet he was grateful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom impatiently
as several others crowded up around Joe.
&ldquo;Every minute&rsquo;s delay makes it worse. Let&rsquo;s
get a move on,&rdquo; and he almost dragged his chum
to the doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>

<p>Dr. Pickett looked grave when told of the cause
of the injury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have a look at the arm,&rdquo; he suggested,
and when he saw a slight swelling he shook
his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t pitch to-morrow,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to,&rdquo; replied Joe simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give him some liniment to rub on
to take the stiffness out, doctor?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum! Nature is something that doesn&rsquo;t like
to be hurried, young man,&rdquo; responded the physician.
&ldquo;However, it might be worse, and perhaps
if that arm is massaged half the night and up
to the time of the game to-morrow, he might pitch
a few innings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s me for the massage!&rdquo; cried Tom.
&ldquo;Now give us some stuff to rub on, doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Pickett showed Tom how to rub the arm,
and how to knead the muscles to take out the soreness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and gave the boys a prescription to get filled
at the drug store.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried Tom again. He seemed to
have taken charge of Joe as a trainer might have
done. &ldquo;I must get you home and begin work on
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Tom did. He installed himself as rubber-in-chief
in Joe&rsquo;s room, and for several hours
thereafter there was the smell of arnica and pungent
liniment throughout the house. Tom was a
faithful massage artist, and soon some of the soreness
began to get out of the wrenched arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me try to throw a ball across the room,&rdquo;
the pitcher begged of Tom about nine o&rsquo;clock.
&ldquo;I want to see if I can move it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a move!&rdquo; sternly forbade the nurse.
&ldquo;You just keep quiet. If you can pitch in the
morning you&rsquo;ll be lucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At intervals until nearly midnight Tom rubbed
the arm and then, knowing that Joe must have
rest, he installed himself on a couch in his chum&rsquo;s
room, and let Joe go to sleep, with his arm
wrapped in hot towels saturated with witch hazel,
a warm flat iron keeping the heat up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how goes it?&rdquo; Joe heard some one say,
as he opened his eyes to find the sun streaming in
his room. The young pitcher tried to raise his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
arm but could not. It seemed as heavy as lead
and a look of alarm came over his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; explained Tom. &ldquo;Wait
until I get off some of the towels. It looks like
an Egyptian mummy now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom loosed the wrappings and then, to Joe&rsquo;s
delight, he found that he could move his arm
with only a little pain resulting. He was about
to swing it, as he did when pitching, but Tom
called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on now! Wait until I rub it a bit and
get up the circulation.&rdquo; The rubbing did good,
and Joe found that he had nearly full control of
the hand and arm. They were a bit stiff to be
sure, but much better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for a good breakfast, some more rubbing,
then some more, and a little light practice,&rdquo;
decided Tom, and Joe smiled, but he gave in and
ate a hearty meal.</p>

<p>Once more faithful Tom massaged the arm,
and rubbed in a salve designed to make the sore
muscles and tendons limber. Not until then would
he allow Joe to go down in the yard and throw a
few balls.</p>

<p>The delivery of the first one brought a look of
agony on the pitcher&rsquo;s face, but he kept at it until
he was nearly himself again. Then came more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
rubbing and another application of salve and liniment,
until Joe declared that there wouldn&rsquo;t be
any skin left on his arm, and that he&rsquo;d smell like
a walking drug store for a week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care, as long as you can pitch,&rdquo; said
Clara. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the game and I&rsquo;m going to
take Mabel Davis and Helen Rutherford. They
both want to see you pitch, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said her brother with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll take another trip to the doctor&rsquo;s
and see what he says,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s next order.
The physician looked gratified when he saw the
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either it wasn&rsquo;t as badly strained as I thought
it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or that medicine worked wonders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my rubbing,&rdquo; explained Tom, puffing
out his chest in pretended pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that certainly completed the cure,&rdquo; admitted
the physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I can pitch?&rdquo; asked Joe anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a few innings. Have your arm rubbed
at intervals in the game, and wear a wrist strap.
Good luck and I hope you&rsquo;ll win,&rdquo; and with a
smile he dismissed them.</p>

<p>Wearing a wrist strap helped greatly, and when
it was nearly time to leave for Fayetteville Joe
found that his arm was much better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long I can last,&rdquo; he said to
Darrell, &ldquo;and maybe I&rsquo;ll be batted out of the
box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad, of course,&rdquo; replied the manager,
when the accident had been explained to him, &ldquo;but
we won&rsquo;t work you very hard. I want you to get
your chance, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Joe felt his heart beat faster as he thought
how nearly he had lost his chance. Yet he could
not have done otherwise, he reflected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s keeping Sam Morton,&rdquo;
mused Captain Rankin, as the team prepared to
take the special trolley car. &ldquo;He met me a little
while ago and said he&rsquo;d be on hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early yet,&rdquo; commented the manager. &ldquo;I
guess he&rsquo;ll be on hand. I told him Joe was going
to pitch a few innings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t cut up nearly as much as I
thought he would. He said it was only fair to
give him a show, but I know Sam is jealous and
he won&rsquo;t take any chances on not being there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of the players, save the regular pitcher,
were on hand now and they were anxiously waiting
for Sam. One of the inspectors of the trolley line
came up to where the boys stood about the special
car that was on a siding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; began the inspector, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to send
you boys on your way now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But our special isn&rsquo;t due to leave for half an
hour,&rdquo; complained Darrell. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re waiting for
Sam Morton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help that. I&rsquo;ve got to start you off
sooner than I expected. There&rsquo;s been a change
in the schedule that I didn&rsquo;t expect, and if I don&rsquo;t
get you off now I can&rsquo;t for another hour, as the
line to Fayetteville will be blocked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means we&rsquo;ll be half an hour later than
we expected,&rdquo; said Darrell. &ldquo;Well, I suppose
we&rsquo;d better go on. Sam can come by the regular
trolley, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, he&rsquo;ll be in Fayetteville in plenty of
time,&rdquo; suggested the inspector. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here and
tell him about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no other way out of it, and soon the
team and the substitutes, with the exception of
Sam, were on their way. There was quite a crowd
already gathered on the Academy grounds when
they arrived and they were noisily greeted by their
opponents as well as by some of their own &ldquo;rooters.&rdquo;
The Academy lads were at practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a snappy lot of youngsters,&rdquo; commented
Darrell, as he watched them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we won&rsquo;t have any walk-over,&rdquo; said the
captain.</p>

<p>The Silver Star lads lost no time in getting into
their uniforms. Tom gave Joe&rsquo;s arm a good
rubbing and then he caught for him for a while
until Joe announced that, aside from a little soreness,
he was all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try it with Ferguson now,&rdquo; ordered Darrell,
motioning to the regular catcher, and Joe did so,
receiving compliments from the backstop for his
accuracy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little more speed and you&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em guessing,&rdquo;
said the catcher genially. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t strain
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minutes ticked on. Several of the regular
cars had come in from Riverside but there was no
sign of Sam Morton. Darrell and Captain Rankin
held an earnest conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose is keeping him?&rdquo; asked
the manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine. Unless he is deliberately
staying away to throw the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sam wouldn&rsquo;t do that. He&rsquo;s too anxious
to pitch. We&rsquo;ll wait a few more cars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if he doesn&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darrell shrugged his shoulders and looked over
to where Joe was practicing with Bart Ferguson.</p>

<h3>JOE IN THE BOX</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well, when are you fellows going to start?&rdquo;
asked Tony Johnson, captain of the Academy
nine, as he ceased his catching practice with Ed.
Wilson, the pitcher. &ldquo;The game ought to have
been called ten minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our pitcher isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; said Darrell anxiously.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re expecting him every minute. If you
could wait a little longer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any one else you can put in?&rdquo;
asked Ferd Backus, the manager. &ldquo;I saw some
one practicing a while ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t our regular pitcher,&rdquo; said George
Rankin, &ldquo;but if Sam doesn&rsquo;t come we&rsquo;ll have to
lead off with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe had been aware that Sam was not on hand.
He looked up as car after car passed the grounds,
thinking to see Sam enter, for the electric vehicles
from Riverside ran close to the Academy diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;ll put Parnell in at the start,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Joe mused, naming the second baseman who sometimes
acted as pitcher for the Stars. Joe did not
dare hope that he himself would be chosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how much longer?&rdquo; demanded Johnson,
when two more cars had passed and Sam was
on neither of them. &ldquo;We want to finish this
game before dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented Darrell briskly. &ldquo;Get
your men ready, Rankin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who will pitch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Matson, of course. It&rsquo;s the only thing
we can do. Take the field, fellows. Joe, take
your place in the box!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;me?&rdquo; gasped our hero, unable to believe
the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you,&rdquo; and Darrell smiled. &ldquo;Do your
prettiest now. You&rsquo;re going in at the beginning
instead of at the end. It&rsquo;s different from what I
planned, but I guess I can depend on you. Hold
&rsquo;em down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; cried Joe fiercely and he forgot his
injured arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; ordered the umpire and Joe took
his place as pitcher for the Silver Stars for the
first time. No wonder his heart beat faster than
usual. The Stars were to bat last, Rankin having
won the toss. It must be remembered that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
boys were amateur players and did not always
follow league rules of having the home team up
last.</p>

<p>The usual number of practice balls were allowed
between Joe and the catcher at the plate and
Bart noted with satisfaction that Joe was cool and
steady and that he did not try for speed.</p>

<p>Then the first man for the Academy&mdash;their
best hitter&mdash;faced our hero. Bart gave the signal
for a slow straight ball over the plate at an angle.
It was the beginning of a cross-fire which he and
Joe had quickly agreed upon, and, as is well
known, the ability of a pitcher to deliver a good
cross-fire wins many games. Cross-firing is merely
sending the ball first over one side of the plate
then the other and then right over centre. Joe
had done it in practice. Could he do it in the
game?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike one!&rdquo; called the umpire, when the first
ball found lodgment in Bart&rsquo;s big glove. There
was a little gasp of protest from the Academy
crowd, but they said nothing. Their man had not
struck at the ball, but it had been in the right
place and Joe knew he had a fair umpire with
whom to deal.</p>

<p>His next delivery was a ball, but the third was a
strike though the man had not moved his bat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit it&mdash;hit it!&rdquo; pleaded his friends.</p>

<p>The batter swung fiercely at the next ball and
knocked a little pop fly which Bart gathered in and
one man was down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it again!&rdquo; called Darrell to his pitcher,
and Joe smiled. His arm pained him a little, but
he gritted his teeth and delivered the next man a
strike, for the batter missed it cleanly. He was
not so lucky in his following trial, for the batter
got to first mainly because of an error in the play
of Fred Newton, at short, who fumbled the pick-up
and delayed in getting the ball to Darrell.</p>

<p>Joe succeeded in striking out the third man up,
though the one who had gone to first managed to
steal second. There were now two out and a man
on the middle bag when Joe faced his fourth opponent.
He tried for a slow out but something
went wrong and the man hit for two sacks, bringing
in the run. But that was all, for the next batter
fell for some slow, easy balls and fanned the air.</p>

<p>The Academys had one run and it looked a
trifle disheartening to the Silver Stars until they
came up and found that the pitcher opposed to
them was very weak. They hammered him
pretty badly in the last half of the first, and three
runs were credited to them ere they had to take
the field again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad; eh?&rdquo; asked Rankin of Darrell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine, if Joe can only keep it up. How&rsquo;s your
arm?&rdquo; he asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; exclaimed our hero, but in truth it
pained him considerably in spite of the treatment
Tom Davis gave it.</p>

<p>The Academy team didn&rsquo;t get a run in the second
inning though Joe was found for some short,
scattering hits. A man got to second and one to
third, mainly through errors in the outfield force,
one bad one being furnished by Tom, who was
at centre in Joe&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll forgive you for getting Joe&rsquo;s arm
in shape,&rdquo; said the manager with a smile.</p>

<p>In their half of the second the Stars got two
runs, and succeeded in forcing another goose egg
on their opponents in the home team&rsquo;s half of the
third. Joe did not do so well this time, for
he was beginning to tire and only a brace on
the part of his supporting players saved him from
having a number of runs come in on his errors.</p>

<p>One run for the Stars marked their efforts in
the third and when the fourth inning began it
looked as if it was a foregone conclusion that the
visiting team would go home with the scalp of
their enemy. But Joe could not keep up the pace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
he had set for himself. No young and inexperienced
pitcher could, much less one with a sore
arm.</p>

<p>The muscles ached very much in spite of all
Tom could do with rubbing in the liniment, but
Joe gritted his teeth and keep his place in the
pitcher&rsquo;s box. He knew he dared not give in.
Only two runs were earned, however, though he
was pretty badly pounded, and this only made the
score three to six in favor of the Stars, when their
half of the fourth came. But they were unable to
better it for the Academy lads took a brace after
an earnest appeal by their captain and manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make &rsquo;em take a goose egg!&rdquo; yelled the student
lads to their friends, and the Stars were
forced to be content with this.</p>

<p>In the fifth inning neither side scored, Joe holding
his own well, and only allowing one hit, which
amounted to nothing. And in the sixth when, with
only three scattered hits, not a run was chalked
up for the home team, Darrell ran over to Joe and
cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine, old man! Can you keep it up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to!&rdquo; burst out Joe, though he
had to grit his teeth to keep back an expression of
pain when he moved his pitching arm.</p>

<h3>SAM ARRIVES</h3>


<p>Whether the Stars were determined to show
their opponents what they could do when they
tried or whether it was because they wanted to
show their confidence in Joe, or even whether it
was due to a slump in the playing of the Academy
team, was not made manifest, but at any rate in
their half of the sixth inning our friends gathered
in four runs, making the score ten to three in their
favor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a walk-over,&rdquo; boasted Tom Davis as
he did an impromptu war dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em beat a mile,&rdquo; added Seth
Potter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure,&rdquo; commented the Academy
captain. &ldquo;No game is won until it&rsquo;s over and
we&rsquo;ve got three more innings yet. The seventh
is always our lucky number.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to all you can get,&rdquo; rejoined
Captain Rankin with a laugh. &ldquo;Seven is where
we always eat pie, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Stars were about to take the field for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
beginning of the seventh when there was a commotion
over at one entrance gate. A lad came
running through the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Wait! I&rsquo;m going to
play. Let me pitch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam Morton!&rdquo; burst out Tom Davis. &ldquo;Why
couldn&rsquo;t he stay away until we had the game won?
I&rsquo;ll bet we slump as soon as he goes in the box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam came on running. He was panting and out
of breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Where were you?&rdquo; demanded
Darrell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got on&mdash;the wrong car. I thought it&mdash;came
here. They&mdash;took me off&mdash;in the woods&mdash;somewhere.
I&rsquo;ve had an awful time&mdash;getting
here. Is the game&mdash;over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re just starting the seventh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I pitch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darrell hesitated. It was a perfectly natural
request for Sam and yet Joe had been doing so
well that both the manager and the captain disliked
to take him off the mound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I pitch?&rdquo; again demanded Sam. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that Joe Matson has&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe hasn&rsquo;t done anything but what we wanted
him to,&rdquo; put in Rankin quickly, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s made a
good record.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose so,&rdquo; sneered Sam. &ldquo;Well, if
you don&rsquo;t want me to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you can pitch,&rdquo; said Darrell quietly.
It was unquestioningly Sam&rsquo;s right and though
he was in rather an exhausted condition still the
manager and captain knew that he was at his best
early in his game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do; change pitchers?&rdquo;
demanded the manager of the Academy team,
striding up to Darrell and Captain Rankin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the rules. You&rsquo;ve got to have
some one bat for him first. You can&rsquo;t change until
next inning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was quite a mix-up, and rules were
quoted and mis-quoted back and forth, for, as I
have said, the lads were far from being professional
or even college players. The upshot of it
was that Sam was allowed to go in, whether or
not in accordance with the rules the boys did not
decide, and the little feeling that had been raised
soon subsided, for they were all true sportsmen.</p>

<p>As for Joe, at first he felt humiliated that he
was displaced but he realized that he had had
more honor that he had at first expected, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
arm was beginning to pain him very much. So,
on the whole, he was glad Sam had arrived when
he did.</p>

<p>Not so the captain, manager and other Star
players, however, for Sam allowed two runs while
he occupied the box, and the Academy team and
their friends were jubilant.</p>

<p>The Stars managed to get two runs in their
half of the seventh. Joe did not play, his place
at centre field continuing to be filled by Tom.
Joe was glad of the rest and he watched the efforts
of his rival closely.</p>

<p>In the eighth Sam did not seem able to pull himself
together and three runs were due to his poor
pitching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, if we play innings enough we&rsquo;ll beat &rsquo;em
even with their new pitcher!&rdquo; called some one in
the crowd, anxious to get Sam&rsquo;s &ldquo;goat,&rdquo; or nerve.</p>

<p>And this seemed likely. In their half of the
eighth the Stars only got one run, and when the
ninth inning opened there were some anxious
hearts among the members of the visiting team.</p>

<p>And then came a terrible slump. Sam grew
wild, allowed bases on balls, struck one man and
muffed an easy fly. When the route and riot were
over there were five runs to the credit of the
schoolboy players and they had tied the score,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
pulling up from a long way in the rear. The
crowd went wild for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, we&rsquo;ve got to make our half of this
inning count,&rdquo; said Darrell earnestly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
making fools of us and they&rsquo;re not in our class at
all. We&rsquo;ve got to beat them! Sam, wake up!&rdquo;
he said sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asleep!&rdquo; retorted the pitcher. &ldquo;If
you think I am why don&rsquo;t you send that Matson in
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy now, easy,&rdquo; spoke Rankin. &ldquo;You can
pitch if you pull yourself together, and if we can&rsquo;t
make a run this inning and it goes to the tenth
you&rsquo;ll have to unwind some curves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, but it won&rsquo;t go to the tenth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t, for the Stars took a brace and pulled
off one run, winning the game by a score of fourteen
to thirteen. But it had been a close call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you beat us,&rdquo; acknowledged the Academy
manager as the winning run came in. &ldquo;But
it took two pitchers to do it, and you&rsquo;d have done
better if you&rsquo;d stuck to the first one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; admitted Darrell. &ldquo;You played
better than I gave you credit for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you use that first pitcher regularly?&rdquo;
the home captain wanted to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Darrell, and then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
saw Sam standing close beside him, and he did
not finish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you going to say?&rdquo; demanded
Sam roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered the manager in some confusion.
He was saved a further reply by the approach
of a boy who held a note in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Joe Matson here?&rdquo; the lad asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right over there,&rdquo; said Darrell, pointing to
where the young pitcher was talking to Tom
Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a letter for him,&rdquo; the messenger went
on.</p>

<p>Joe rapidly tore open the envelope and read
the few words the note contained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to leave here,&rdquo; he said to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s the matter? Nothing wrong
I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;The note
says I&rsquo;m to come home at once. They&rsquo;ve sent a
carriage for me. I hope nothing has happened to&mdash;to
anybody,&rdquo; and gulping down a suspicious
lump in his throat Joe followed the lad off the
diamond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>JOE FOILS THE PLOTTERS</h3>


<p>There was a carriage waiting just outside the
ball grounds, a carriage drawn by one horse. A
man whom Joe had never seen before, so far as he
knew, held the reins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the man who wants you,&rdquo; explained
the lad who had acted as messenger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked the young pitcher quickly.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him. Where did he come from?
Where did you meet him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;ll tell you all you want to know,&rdquo;
said the lad. &ldquo;All I know is that I was standing
outside the ball grounds after the game, and he
give me that note to bring in to you. I didn&rsquo;t come
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; replied Joe, but he was wondering
who the man was, and how the fellow came to
know that he was in Fayetteville.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope I didn&rsquo;t take you away from the game,&rdquo;
began the man with what he evidently meant for
a pleasant smile. Yet, somehow Joe did not like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
that smile. The man seemed to have a shifty
glance and Joe mistrusted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the game is over,&rdquo; answered the young
pitcher. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t play in the last part. But
what is the matter? Is my mother or father ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing serious,&rdquo; spoke the man. &ldquo;No
one is ill. I came to get you about your father&rsquo;s
patents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. He felt a sensation of
relief until he realized the danger that threatened
his father&rsquo;s inventions. Then he asked: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
wrong? Is Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Then he stopped for he
did not know whether or not to mention names to
this stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give you any particulars,&rdquo; said the man
with another smile. &ldquo;All I can say is that they
engaged me to come and get you to save time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who engaged you?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;He sent me
off in a hurry and said I&rsquo;d find you at this game.
I sent you in the note by the lad. Your father
had no time to write one, but you are to go to him
at once. He wants you to help him about the
patent models I think. We&rsquo;d better hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s suspicions vanished at once. He knew his
father was preparing to send on some models to
Washington and now probably some need of haste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
had arisen necessitating his aid. He climbed up
into the carriage, and though he noted at the time
that the rig did not seem to be from the local livery
stable, which had only a few, he thought nothing
of it then.</p>

<p>The man flicked the horse with the whip and the
animal started off on the jump. Just outside the
ball grounds there was a private road leading into
the main one. On reaching the chief thoroughfare
the man turned north whereas, to reach
Riverside, he should have gone south.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Joe, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going the
wrong way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be easy. It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; answered the man
with a smile. &ldquo;Your father has taken all his
things to a little shop in Denville. He had to have
some changes made in the models I believe, and he
wanted to be in a machine shop where he could
work quietly. He told me to bring you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe remembered that on one or two occasions
Mr. Matson had had some work done in Denville,
and once more the suspicions that had arisen were
lulled. Joe sank back on the cushions and began
thinking of the game just played. His arm was
getting quite stiff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to attend to it as soon as I get
home,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to have it go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
back on me just when things are in such good
shape. If they keep on I may become the regular
pitcher. Sam certainly did poorly in his part of
the game, and I&rsquo;m not getting a swelled head,
either, when I say that.&rdquo; Joe knew he had done
good work, considering his sore arm, and he made
up his mind to do still better.</p>

<p>The man drove along rapidly, and in about an
hour had reached the outskirts of Denville. He
turned down a road that was evidently little used,
to judge by the grass growing in it, and halted the
horse in front of a small building. It did not look
like a place where inventors&rsquo; models would be
made. In fact the shack had a forlorn and forsaken
air about it, and Joe looked curiously at it.
His suspicions were coming back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is my father?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the
man quickly. &ldquo;Hello in there!&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>The next instant Joe saw a face at the window.
Then it disappeared, but that momentary glance
had showed him it was the face of Mr. Isaac Benjamin.
In a second it was all clear to him. He
had been trapped. He attempted to spring from
the carriage seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on to your game!&rdquo; he exclaimed to the
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you? Well, you&rsquo;re not going to get
away!&rdquo; and with that the man grabbed Joe
around the waist, pinning his arms to his sides.
Then from the little building came running Mr.
Benjamin and Mr. Holdney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get him all right?&rdquo; asked the manager
of the harvester works eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly did,&rdquo; panted the other man, for
Joe was struggling to get loose. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t give me
any trouble either, until just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll make lots of trouble for you, if
you don&rsquo;t let me go!&rdquo; cried Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, young man, take it easy,&rdquo; advised Mr.
Benjamin. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t intend to do you a bit of
harm, and we only brought you to this place to
have a quiet talk with you. It&rsquo;s in your father&rsquo;s
interest and I hope you&rsquo;ll overlook the unconventional
way we took to get you here. Bring him
in,&rdquo; he added to the man in the carriage and,
despite Joe&rsquo;s struggles he was lifted out and carried
into the little building. The door was shut
and locked, and he was alone with his three captors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want of me?&rdquo; hotly demanded
the lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get excited and we&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo;
said Mr. Benjamin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about your father&rsquo;s
patents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Holdney, &ldquo;we want to
know where they are. He had no right to take the
papers and models away from the harvester
works. Those inventions are the property of the
company and aren&rsquo;t your father&rsquo;s at all. We
want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better let me talk to him,&rdquo; advised Mr. Benjamin.
&ldquo;Now Joe, you can&rsquo;t understand all the
ins and outs of this business, for it&rsquo;s very complicated.
You know that your father is working
on certain patents about a corn reaper and binder;
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Joe cautiously, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not
going to tell you anything about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will after you hear all I have to
say,&rdquo; went on Mr. Benjamin. &ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s like
this: Your father is unduly alarmed about the
safety of his rights in the patents, and I will admit
that he has some rights. For some reason he saw
fit to take his models and papers away from the
shop at the harvester works where he was engaged
on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe smiled&mdash;well he knew why his father had
removed the valuable models and papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What we want,&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin, &ldquo;is to
get access to those models. We want to see them
for a short time, and also look over the papers.
Now you can fix that for us if you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> ask my father?&rdquo; inquired Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Holdney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t listen to reason,&rdquo; put in Mr. Benjamin.
&ldquo;He thinks we would deprive him of his
rights.&rdquo; Joe thought so too, but he said nothing.
&ldquo;Now if you can quietly get those models and
papers and let us have a look at them they will
be returned to you without fail,&rdquo; said the manager.
&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s rights will be fully protected. It
may seem strange to you for us to make this
proposition in this way, and bring you here as we
have done, but it was necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I refuse?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Holdney, in blustering
tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, now, easy,&rdquo; cautioned Mr. Benjamin.
&ldquo;The consequences may be disastrous for your
father,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I am doing this for his
own good. He will not hear of showing the
models, but if you can get them for us it will save
much trouble and annoyance for&mdash;well, for all of
us. If you don&rsquo;t, your father may lose all he possesses
and be without a position. I know what inventors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
are. They can only see one thing at a
time. It is a simple thing that we ask of you.
Will you do it? Now, you needn&rsquo;t answer at once.
Take a little time to think it over. Go in that
room there and wait. We&rsquo;ll give you half an
hour. If by that time you don&rsquo;t decide to help us
we&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll <i>make</i> you!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Holdney.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got too much money tied up in this to see it
lost by the obstinacy of a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you refuse, we will have to take other
measures,&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin, with a shrug of
his shoulders.</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s heart was beating fast. He did not
know what to do. Being practically kidnapped
after he had worked so hard in the game, his fears
for his father aroused, it is no wonder that he
could not think clearly. He welcomed the chance
to go off quietly by himself, but never for a moment
did he think of betraying his father. Only
for an instant did he place any confidence in what
the wily manager had said. Then he knew there
must be a trick in it all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if I let them trap me it&rsquo;s my own fault,&rdquo;
thought Joe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to think up some way of
escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the manager as Joe hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; answered the young
pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. You can go in that room,&rdquo; and Mr.
Benjamin opened the door of an apartment leading
out of the main one.</p>

<p>Joe cast a quick glance about it as the door
closed behind him. He noted that it was not
locked, but that with three men in the outer room
the boy knew he could not escape that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to escape if I can,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any more time to think over
what I&rsquo;m going to do. They shan&rsquo;t have a glance
at dad&rsquo;s models and papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A rapid survey of the room showed him that it
had but one window and that was heavily barred.
He raised the sash softly and tried the bars. They
were rusty but held firmly in the wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use trying that way,&rdquo; murmured Joe. He
heard the hum of voices in the outer room and
listened at the keyhole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he can get away?&rdquo; he heard
the man who had brought him to the place ask
the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; was the answer from
Mr. Benjamin. &ldquo;After all, we couldn&rsquo;t hope to
keep him a prisoner long. There would be too
much hue and cry over it. All I expect is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
he&rsquo;ll be so worried and frightened that he&rsquo;ll tell
us what we want to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve got another think coming,&rdquo; whispered
Joe.</p>

<p>He walked back to the window once more and,
as he crossed the room he saw what looked like a
trap door in the floor. Kneeling down he applied
his nose to the crack. There came up the
damp, musty smell of a cellar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Joe. &ldquo;If I can get that
door up I can drop into the cellar even if there
aren&rsquo;t any stairs, and I guess I can get out of the
cellar. But can I get that door up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no ring to lift it by, and no handle,
but Joe was a resourceful lad and in an instant his
knife was out. With the big blade inserted in the
crack he managed to raised the door a trifle. He
endeavored to hold the advantage he had gained
until he could take out the knife blade and insert
it again farther down, but the door slipped
through his fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get some way of holding it up
after each time I pry,&rdquo; he thought. A hurried
search through his pockets brought to light part
of a broken toe plate. He had had a new one
put on for the Academy game, and had thrust the
broken piece in the pocket of his trousers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This ought to do it,&rdquo; he reasoned, and it did,
for with the aid of that Joe was able to hold up
and raise the trap door. The damp, musty smell
was stronger now, and Joe was glad to see, in the
dim darkness of the cellar, a flight of steps.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re pretty rotten, but I guess they&rsquo;ll hold
me,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>The next instant he was going down them, and
he let the trap door fall softly into place over his
head. It was so dark in the cellar now that he
could see nothing, but when his eyes became accustomed
to the blackness he saw the dim light of
an outer window.</p>

<p>It was the work of but a moment to scramble
through it, and a few seconds later Joe was running
away from the place of his brief captivity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I won&rsquo;t give you an answer to-day,&rdquo;
he murmured as he looked back.</p>

<p>He heard a shout and saw Mr. Benjamin rush
out. Then our hero caught sight of the horse and
carriage and like a flash he made for it. Jumping
in he called to the animal and was soon galloping
down the road while the shouts behind him became
fainter and fainter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the time I fooled you!&rdquo; cried Joe exultantly,
as he urged on the horse.</p>

<h3>SAM RESIGNS</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Those desperate men! You must have them
arrested at once!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Matson when
Joe, a little later, had reached home, having left
the horse and carriage at the local livery stable
to be claimed. &ldquo;You ought to go to the police
at once, John! Why think of what might have
happened to Joe,&rdquo; for the boy had told the whole
story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; said Joe who, now that
the excitement was over, and he had so completely
turned the tables on the plotters, was rather inclined
to laugh at the experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are worse things than that done to get
possession of valuable patents,&rdquo; said Mr. Matson.
&ldquo;Those men are evidently desperate, though why
Mr. Holdney should turn against me I cannot understand.
But I would rather wait, and take no
action right away. My work is almost finished
and if all goes well I shall soon be independent of
the harvester people. If, however, there is a slip-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
I will be dependent on my position for a living.
I think I will wait and see what develops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in the morning there was a new turn to
affairs. It was announced at the harvester factory
that Mr. Benjamin had gone away for an indefinite
stay, and a new manager had his place. This
made it unnecessary for Mr. Matson to say anything.
He wrote a strong letter of protest to Mr.
Holdney, and then worked harder than ever to get
his patents in shape so he would be fully protected
in them.</p>

<p>As for Joe he said nothing to any of his chums
about his experience. The rig was claimed later
by a man who would not give his name, and who
drove off hurriedly, as if he feared arrest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;m going to get back to baseball,&rdquo;
announced the young pitcher.</p>

<p>His arm got better rapidly after the Academy
game, and he was soon pitching in practice with
his former vim and vigor. He was now regarded
as the regular substitute twirler for the Silver
Stars.</p>

<p>Sam Morton, too, was regular in his practice,
and there seemed to be something different about
him. He was more careful in his conduct, and not
as surly as he had been. He accepted criticism
in a better spirit, and in one game against the scrub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
he did such unusually excellent work that the manager
complimented him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just keep that up on Saturday,&rdquo; said Darrell,
&ldquo;and we won&rsquo;t let the Fairdale Blues have a
run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be there with the goods all right,&rdquo;
boasted Sam. He glanced at Joe as he said this
as much as to intimate that his rival would not get
a chance in the box.</p>

<p>The Fairdale Blues were a strong team, and,
as they had beaten the Stars several times, and had
also won from the Resolutes, who were considered
the strongest team in the county, more than the
usual interest attached to the coming contest.</p>

<p>It was to be played on the Stars&rsquo; grounds, and
early on the day of the game the grandstand and
bleachers began to fill. The Blues arrived in several
big carryalls with a noisy crowd of &ldquo;rooters&rdquo;
carrying horns, bells and clappers&mdash;anything
with which to make a racket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get Sam&rsquo;s goat if he isn&rsquo;t careful,&rdquo; observed
Rodney Burke, when the Stars went out to
practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fool yourself,&rdquo; retorted Sam.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pitch a no-hit no-run game to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like Sam&mdash;boasting as usual,&rdquo; commented
Rodney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think he&rsquo;ll make good,&rdquo; said an admirer
of the pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until you see what kind of hitters the
Blues have,&rdquo; cautioned Rodney. &ldquo;They may
knock Sam out of the box. Then if Joe goes
in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, Joe won&rsquo;t get a chance to-day,&rdquo; was the
retort. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t had enough practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look what he did to the Academy team,&rdquo; reminded
Rodney.</p>

<p>And then further talk was stopped, for the gong
rang to clear the diamond. The game was about
to begin.</p>

<p>The Stars took the field, for they were to bat
last, and Sam faced his first opponent with a smile
of confidence on his face. It faded away a moment
later, however, as the lad knocked as pretty
a three bagger as had been seen on the grounds in
many a day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Line &rsquo;em out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re on to his curves all right!&rdquo; yelled
the crowd. Joe, who was on the bench as a reserve
pitcher, jumped to his feet and watched the
ball roll past Tom who was playing centre. It
looked almost as if the batter would come on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
home, but he held third and the fears of the Stars
subsided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool him now, Sam,&rdquo; called Darrell to the
pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make him give you a nice one,&rdquo; was the advice
the next batter got from his friends. And he
did, though it was only good for one bag. However,
the run came in, and there were gloomy
hearts in the camp of the Silver Stars.</p>

<p>Sam managed to strike out the next man, and
his confidence came back. But it was only for a
short time. The crowd of Blue &ldquo;rooters&rdquo; was
making a terrific racket and this may have gotten
on Sam&rsquo;s nerves, at any rate he gave the next man
his base on balls and was later hit for two two
baggers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve got his goat! We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em going!
Everybody take a run!&rdquo; yelled the visiting
captain, jumping up and down at the third base
coaching line.</p>

<p>Darrell ran over to Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to pull yourself together,&rdquo; he said
quickly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to lose this game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing the best I can,&rdquo; retorted Sam.
&ldquo;The ball slips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it slip&mdash;slips are dangerous,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the manager sharply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to do better
or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; yelled the umpire and Darrell ran
back to his place at first base. Sam scowled at him,
and then wound up for his next delivery.</p>

<p>Somehow they managed to get three out, but
there were five runs in the Blue frame when that
inning ended, and only two for the Stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stand this,&rdquo; said Rankin to the manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, if Sam doesn&rsquo;t improve this inning I&rsquo;m
going to put in Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam will raise a row.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if he does. Why doesn&rsquo;t he pitch
decent ball if he wants to hold his place? They&rsquo;re
laughing at the Stars now, and they didn&rsquo;t used
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it. Well, maybe he&rsquo;ll improve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sam didn&rsquo;t. He could not seem to control
the ball, his curves broke just about where the batters
wanted them and they knocked out three runs
that inning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matson bats for Morton!&rdquo; announced the
umpire when it came the turn of the Stars and the
change had been mentioned to the score keepers
by Darrell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; cried Sam, striding
to where the captain and manager sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means that Joe is going to pitch the rest of
this game,&rdquo; was the quiet answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is?&rdquo; Sam&rsquo;s voice rose high in anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He certainly is. You can&rsquo;t seem to do it, Sam.
I&rsquo;m sorry, but we can&rsquo;t afford to lose. We&rsquo;re near
the tail end of the league now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam shot a look at the captain. Rankin nodded
his head to confirm what the manager had said.
Then the deposed pitcher strode over to where
the score keepers sat. Taking up a piece of paper
and a pencil he rapidly wrote something and
handed it to Darrell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked the manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My resignation from the Silver Star Baseball
Club,&rdquo; snapped Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done pitching for you.
It was all a put-up job to get me out, and that Matson
lad in. I&rsquo;m through,&rdquo; and he turned aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; assented Darrell quietly. &ldquo;If
you feel that way about it perhaps it is better that
you quit. But I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; yelled the umpire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe, bat for Sam and then take the box,&rdquo; said
the manager, and there was a little subdued applause
from the other Star players on the bench.
It was their way of congratulating Joe.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>BAD NEWS</h3>


<p>Joe was plainly nervous. Being called on so
suddenly had its effect as did the unexpected action
of Sam in resigning because Joe had supplanted
him. But the young pitcher knew that he
must pull himself together.</p>

<p>The game was slipping away from the Stars and
the crowd of shouters that accompanied the Blues
would redouble their efforts to get Joe&rsquo;s &ldquo;goat&rdquo;
as soon as he got in the box.</p>

<p>He had a foretaste of what they would do
when he got up to bat in Sam&rsquo;s place and struck
out. It was no discredit to Joe, for the Blues
had a fine pitcher, still it added to his nervousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s a sample of what your new pitcher
can do we&rsquo;ll take a few more runs!&rdquo; yelled a Blue
sympathizer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he only did that for fun!&rdquo; yelled Rodney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Tom Davis. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s saving his
arm to strike you fellows out. Go to it, Joe!
Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em rattle you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>
<p>The Stars took a brace, whether it was the
knowledge that Joe was to pitch or not, but they
certainly braced, and in that inning got enough
runs to make the score six to eight in favor of the
visiting team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Joe, hold &rsquo;em down!&rdquo; pleaded Darrell,
&ldquo;and we can do the rest, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; answered our hero.</p>

<p>It would be too much to expect Joe to do wonders,
but he did very well. He only allowed two
hits in the inning when he first pitched and only
one run came in, chiefly through an error on the
part of the third baseman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve got their number now,&rdquo; exulted
Darrell, when it came the turn of the Stars to bat.
&ldquo;Keep up the good work, boys. We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em
going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Stars managed to knock out two runs in
their half of the third inning and that made the
score eight to nine&mdash;one extra tally only against
them.</p>

<p>And then began what was really a remarkable
game for one played between amateur nines. For
the next four innings neither side got a run. Talk
of a &ldquo;pitchers&rsquo; battle&rdquo; began to be whispered, and
for the credit of the visitors be it said that they
no longer tried to get Joe&rsquo;s &ldquo;goat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<p>Both pitchers were on their mettle. Of course
they were not perfect and probably some deliveries
that the umpire called strikes were balls, just as
some that he designated as balls were good strikes.
But it was all in the game. <a href="#frontispiece">Joe was doing good
work.</a> There were only a few scattered hits off
him and these were easily taken care of by the in
or out fielders. In this the Blues rather excelled,
however, there being more errors charged up
against the home team than to them.</p>

<p>But the Stars had this in their favor; that, while
there were a number of good stick men among the
visitors, they were not speedy base-runners and
thus a number of men were nabbed on the sacks,
through playing off too far, or not connecting
in time, who otherwise might have brought in
runs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, fellows, we&rsquo;ve got to do something!&rdquo;
cried the captain at the close of the usual lucky
seventh, when no runs had been registered for
either side. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t some of you pull off a
run?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was the Blue team who scored first, getting
one run on a ball hit by the first man up. It
was manifestly a foul, but the umpire called it fair
and the man held his base. Then Joe&rsquo;s arm gave
him a twinge and he was hit for a three bagger by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the next man up, scoring the player preceding him.
But that was all.</p>

<p>With grimly tightened lips Joe faced his next
opponent and after that not a man got to first,
and the player on third dared not steal home, so
keenly was he watched.</p>

<p>With the score eight to ten against them the
Stars came in more confidently than might have
been expected. And when they had hammered out
two runs, tieing the score, there was wild enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we walk away from them!&rdquo;
yelled Rodney, as the second run came in, and with
only one man out. But there came a slump and the
opposing pitcher braced up, striking out two men
in succession.</p>

<p>The ninth inning saw a single run tallied up for
the visitors, and in this connection Joe did some
great work, pulling down a fly that was well over
his head and receiving a round of applause for his
pluck, for it was a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; one.</p>

<p>The unexpected happened in the ending of the
ninth, when the visitors were one ahead. Seth
Potter, never reckoned as a heavy hitter brought
in a home run, and the score was once more a tie
for no one else crossed home plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten innings!&rdquo; was the cry and the spectators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
began &ldquo;sitting up and taking notice&rdquo; as Rodney
Burke said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Joe, it&rsquo;s up to you to shut them out,&rdquo;
advised the captain. The young pitcher nodded
and then he cut loose.</p>

<p>His arm was paining him very much for by a
sudden twist he had wrenched the muscles injured
in saving the lad from the trolley car. But Joe
would not give up, and he struck out three men
neatly, only one, the second up, getting any kind of
a hit, and that only good for the initial bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A goose egg!&rdquo; yelled Rodney Burke. &ldquo;Now
one run will do the trick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snow &rsquo;em under!&rdquo; cried Darrell.</p>

<p>And the Stars did, for they rapped out the
necessary run amid a jubilant riot of cheers, making
the final score twelve to eleven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I knew you could do it! I knew you
could!&rdquo; cried the captain, trying to embrace all his
lads at once. They had won handily though at
one time it looked like defeat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good work, Joe,&rdquo; complimented Darrell.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the regular pitcher from now on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if Sam reconsiders his resignation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; rejoined the manager. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out
for good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe could hardly wait to get home and tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
good news. He fairly raced into the house, but
he stopped short at the sight of his father and
mother in the dining room. They were seated at
the table and a look of anxiety was on their faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; gasped Joe, all his joy
in the victory and his new position leaving him as
he looked at his parents. On the table between
them lay a number of papers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been served with a summons from the
court,&rdquo; said Mr. Matson slowly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a move on
the part of Benjamin and Holdney. The court
has taken my patent models and documents away
from me, and I may lose everything. It&rsquo;s hard,
just as I was about to succeed&mdash;very hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you may lose everything, dad?&rdquo; asked
Joe huskily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;everything son&mdash;I may have to start all
over again. I&rsquo;m out of the harvester works now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment one disappointing thought came
to Joe. He would not be able to go to a boarding
school as he had hoped. Then the look of trouble
on his father&rsquo;s face drove all other thoughts from
his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care, dad!&rdquo; he exclaimed stepping
close to him. &ldquo;You can beat those fellows yet.
We whipped the Blues to-day, and I&rsquo;m the regular
pitcher for the Stars!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>THE FIGHT</h3>


<p>There was a moment of silence following Joe&rsquo;s
remark about being made regular pitcher. Then
Clara laughed and it was almost a laugh of relief,
for she had been under quite a strain since she
came in and heard the bad news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you silly boy!&rdquo; cried Clara. &ldquo;Just as if
your being made pitcher was going to help. I
suppose you&rsquo;ll turn all your salary in to help out
now; won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; but there was no sting intended
in her words and, fearing there might have been
just the touch of it, she crossed the room and tried
to slip her arm up around Joe&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried as gaily as possible
under the circumstances, &ldquo;fen on kissing. But say,
dad, is it as bad as all that? Have Benjamin and
his crowd beaten you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, son. At least they&rsquo;ve won the
first skirmish in the battle. Now it&rsquo;s up to the
courts, and it may take a year or more to settle the
question of whether or not I have any rights in
the inventions I originated. But don&rsquo;t let that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
worry you,&rdquo; he went on more cheerfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
make out somehow. I&rsquo;m glad you got the place
you wanted. How was the game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty good. It was so tight we had to play
ten innings. But can&rsquo;t I do something to help you,
dad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything right away,&rdquo; rejoined
Mr. Matson. &ldquo;We can only wait. I shall have
to see a lawyer, and have him look after my interests.
I never thought that Mr. Benjamin and
Mr. Holdney would treat me this way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry. Perhaps we shall come
out all right, and in the end this may be a good
thing. It will teach me a lesson never again to
trust any one where patents are concerned. I
should have had a written contract and not taken
their mere word that they would treat me right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you are out of the harvester works?&rdquo;
asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out completely,&rdquo; and Mr. Matson smiled. &ldquo;I
have a holiday, Joe, and I&rsquo;m coming to see you
pitch some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but,&rdquo; ventured Clara, &ldquo;if you haven&rsquo;t
any work, dad, you won&rsquo;t get any money and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s what is worrying you!&rdquo; cried
her father with a laugh as he placed his arm
around her. &ldquo;Well, have no fears. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
still a few shots in the locker, and we&rsquo;re not going
to the poorhouse right away. Now, Joe, tell us
all about the ball game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which the young pitcher did with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t this Sam Morton be angry with
you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Matson, who was a gentle
woman, always in fear of violence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;ll be very <i>friendly</i>
toward me,&rdquo; replied Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he may do you some injury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I can take care of myself. I&rsquo;m
not afraid of him, mother, and if it comes to a
fight&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you horrid boys&mdash;always thinking about
fighting!&rdquo; interrupted Clara. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fight,
Joe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t if I can help it, sis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next morning, Joe was in two states of mind.
He was delighted at being the regular pitcher for
the Stars, but he was downcast when he thought
that to go to the boarding school was now out of
the question. And that it would be impossible for
him to think of it under the present financial state
of the family was made plain to him when he spoke
of the matter to his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Joe,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll have to
give up the idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he answered, as cheerfully as he
could, but he went out of the house quickly for
there was a suspicious moisture in his eyes, and
a lump in his throat that would not seem to go
down, no matter how hard he swallowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a chump!&rdquo; he finally exclaimed. &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t want to go to an expensive boarding
school when dad is in such trouble. And yet&mdash;and
yet&mdash;Oh! I <i>do</i> want to get on a big team and
pitch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the days that followed Joe saw little of his
father, for Mr. Matson was out of town trying to
get matters in shape for the court proceedings.
But Joe was kept busy at practice with the Stars,
and in playing games.</p>

<p>The season was in full swing and the Silver
Stars seemed to have struck a streak of winning
luck. Some said it was Joe&rsquo;s pitching, for really he
was doing very well. Others laid it just to luck
and talked darkly of a &ldquo;slump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any slump if you fellows keep
your eyes open, and hit and run,&rdquo; said the manager.</p>

<p>The county league season was drawing to a
close, and as it stood now the championship practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
lay between the Stars and their old enemies
the Resolutes. There was some talk of playing
off a tie, if it should come to that, but when Darrell
mentioned this to the Resolute manager he was
told that the latter team had all dates filled to the
end of the season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t give you a game,&rdquo; he announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Darrell, &ldquo;for we ought to
decide which is the best team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ours is, of course. Didn&rsquo;t we wallop you
once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t do it again,&rdquo; was the quick
retort.</p>

<p>It was several days after this when Joe was
coming home from afternoon practice in preparation
for a game Saturday with the Red Stockings.
As he took a short cut over the fields to get home
more quickly, he was aware of a figure coming
toward him. When too late to turn back he saw
it was Sam Morton. Sam saw Joe and came to a
halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Sam with a sneer, &ldquo;how is the
high-and-mighty pitcher? I suppose you&rsquo;ve been
doing nothing else but handing out no-hit and no-run
games?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite as good as that,&rdquo; admitted Joe with
what he meant for a friendly smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Who you laughing at?&rdquo; demanded Sam
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t laughing,&rdquo; replied Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you were! You were laughing at me
and I won&rsquo;t stand it. You worked and schemed to
get me out of the nine so you could go in, and now
you&rsquo;re making fun of me, I won&rsquo;t stand it, I tell
you. You think you&rsquo;re a pitcher! Well you&rsquo;re
not, and you&rsquo;ll never be. I won&rsquo;t be made fun
of!&rdquo; All the pent-up anger&mdash;unreasoning as it
was,&mdash;all the hate that had been accumulating for
weeks in Sam, burst out at once.</p>

<p>He made a spring for Joe, but the pitcher
stepped back. Not in time, however, for he received
a blow on the chest.</p>

<p>Now I am not defending Joe for what he did. I
am only telling of what happened. Joe was a
manly lad yet he had all the instincts and passions
that normal lads have. When he was hit his first
instinct was to hit back, and he did it in this
case.</p>

<p>His left fist shot forward and clipped Sam on
the chin. The blow was a staggering one and for
a moment the former pitcher reeled. Then with a
roar of rage he came back at Joe, and the pair
were at it hammer and tongs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you that you can&rsquo;t come sneaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
around here and steal my place!&rdquo; blubbered Sam,
as he aimed a blow at Joe&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sneak!&rdquo; retorted Joe, as he dodged
the blow and got a right-hander near Sam&rsquo;s solar
plexus.</p>

<p>Both lads were evenly matched and the fight
might have gone on for some time but for Sam&rsquo;s
rage which made him reckless. He left unguarded
openings of which Joe took quick advantage, and
finally, with a straight left, he sent Sam to the
grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll fix you for that!&rdquo; yelled the former
pitcher as he rushed at Joe. It was easy to step
aside and avoid the clumsy blow, and once more
Sam went down. This time he did not get up so
quickly, and there was a dazed look on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; cried Joe, stepping over to him.
&ldquo;This has gone far enough. I didn&rsquo;t want to
fight, but you made me. I can beat you and you
know it. If you don&rsquo;t stop now I&rsquo;ll knock you
down every time you get up until you&rsquo;ve had
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was brutal talk, perhaps, but it was well
meant. For a moment Sam looked up at his
antagonist. Then he murmured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough&mdash;for the present.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>


<p>The fight was over. Sam arose and started
away. Joe called after him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you shake hands? I&rsquo;m sorry this happened,
but can&rsquo;t we be friends after this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; snarled Sam. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything
to do with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said, and Joe
walked away. He was somewhat stiff and sore,
for a number of Sam&rsquo;s blows had landed with telling
effect. One in particular, on the muscles of his
right forearm, made that member a bit stiff and
numb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to take care of that,&rdquo; thought Joe,
&ldquo;or I can&rsquo;t pitch Saturday.&rdquo; He had only a few
marks of the fight on his face and he was glad of
it, for he did not want his mother or sister to
know.</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s mother did not ask embarrassing questions.
In fact she was thinking of other things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
for she had received a letter from her husband
that day, sent from a distant city. Matters it appeared
were not going as well as they might, but
Mr. Matson had hopes that all would come out
right in the end.</p>

<p>Joe rubbed his sore arm well that night, and
when Saturday came he pitched a great game
against the Red Stockings, allowing only a few
scattered hits. The Stars took the contest by a
big margin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if we could wind up with a game against
the Resolutes and wallop them we&rsquo;d finish out the
season in great shape,&rdquo; commented Captain Rankin,
as he followed his lads off the diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make another try to get them to
play us,&rdquo; said Darrell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to send a
challenge, and intimate that they&rsquo;re afraid to
tackle us since we&rsquo;ve got our new pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was several days later when the nine was at
practice and Darrell had not come out. Tom
Davis was in his place at first and Rodney Burke
was in centre field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s keeping Darrell?&rdquo; said the
captain. &ldquo;He hardly ever misses practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he comes now,&rdquo; announced Joe, &ldquo;and
he&rsquo;s got a letter,&rdquo; for Darrell was waving a paper
as he ran across the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news, boys!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The Resolutes
will play us. I just got word in a special delivery
letter. That&rsquo;s what kept me. Hurray!
Now we&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em what&rsquo;s what. It will be a
grand wind-up for the season and will practically
decide the county championship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried the lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do we play?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This coming Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought they said all their dates were filled,&rdquo;
commented Tom Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were, but some team they counted on
busted up and that left an opening. Then, too, I
fancy that little dig I gave them about being afraid
had its effect. Joe, it&rsquo;s up to you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; and our hero accepted the responsibility
with a smile.</p>

<p>There was considerable excitement among the
Silver Stars over the prospective game. They
were almost too excited to keep on with the practice
against the scrub, but Darrell talked like
a &ldquo;Dutch uncle&rdquo; to them, to quote Rodney
Burke, and they went at their work with renewed
vigor.</p>

<p>When Joe got home that evening after some
hard practice there was another letter from his
father. It was brief, merely saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few days I will know all. My next will
contain good news&mdash;or bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, this suspense is terrible,&rdquo; complained
Mrs. Matson.</p>

<p>The day of the game between the Silver Stars
and their old enemies drew nearer. Joe had practiced
hard and he knew he was in good shape to
pitch. In fact the Stars were much improved by
their season&rsquo;s work, and they were as good an
amateur nine in their class as could be found in the
country.</p>

<p>Word came to them, however, that the Resolutes
were trained to the minute, and were going
to put up a stiff fight for the county championship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Darrell briefly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
want a walk-over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Clara to her brother, on the
Saturday of the game, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it almost time for
you to start if you&rsquo;re going to Rocky Ford?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess I had better be going,&rdquo; answered
Joe. &ldquo;I want to put a few stitches in my glove.
It&rsquo;s ripped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; offered Clara and she had just finished
when the door bell rang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; volunteered Joe, and when he saw a
messenger boy standing there, with a yellow envelope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in his hands somehow the heart of the
young pitcher sank.</p>

<p>Quickly he took the telegram to his mother, to
whom it was addressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You open it, Joe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m
afraid it&rsquo;s bad news. My hand trembles so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe tore open the telegram. It was from his
father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s all up,&rdquo; the message read. &ldquo;I
have practically lost my case, and it looks as if I&rsquo;d
have to start all over again. But don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m
coming home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A silence followed Joe&rsquo;s reading of the few
words aloud. Then indeed it was all over. He
could not go to boarding school after all. He
looked at his mother. There were tears in her
eyes but she bore the shock bravely. Clara was
very pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it might be worse!&rdquo; said Joe philosophically.
&ldquo;There is just a bare chance&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
mighty slim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then from outside came the hail of Tom
Davis:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Joe! Come on! It&rsquo;s time you
started for Rocky Ford. We&rsquo;re going to wallop
the Resolutes!&rdquo; and with the freedom of an old
friend, Joe&rsquo;s chum burst into the room.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>THE WINNING THROW&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>For a moment Tom stood there a bit embarrassed,
for he saw that something unusual had
happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I hope I&rsquo;m not intruding,&rdquo; he stammered.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think&mdash;I came right in as I always do.
Has anything&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe quickly. &ldquo;We
just got word that dad has lost his patent case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! That&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, who
knew something of the affair. &ldquo;What are you
going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pitch against the Resolutes, the
first thing I do!&rdquo; cried Joe. &ldquo;After that I&rsquo;ll decide
what&rsquo;s next. But is my glove mended, Clara?
Come on, Tom, we mustn&rsquo;t be late. We&rsquo;re going
to wallop them&mdash;just as you said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you do!&rdquo; burst out Clara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play a good game and&mdash;and&mdash;don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo;
whispered Mrs. Matson to her son as he kissed
her good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>The team and substitutes were to go to Rocky
Ford in two big stages, in time to get in some practice
on the grounds that were none too familiar to
them. A crowd of Silver Star &ldquo;rooters&rdquo; were to
follow on the trolley. The captain and managers
of the rival teams watched their opponents practice
with sharp eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re snappier than when they beat us before,&rdquo;
was Darrell&rsquo;s conclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a heap sight better pitcher in
Joe than Sam Morton ever was,&rdquo; concluded Captain
Hen Littell of the Resolutes, who twirled for
his team. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what we&rsquo;d
have a mighty close game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last practice was over. The scattered balls
had been collected, the batting list made out and
final details arranged. Once more came the thrilling
cry of the umpire:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Resolutes were to bat last, and Seth Potter
went up to bat first for the Stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swat it,&rdquo; pleaded the crowd, and Seth smiled.
But he fanned the air successively as well as successfully
and soon went back to the bench. Then
came Fred Newton&rsquo;s turn and he knocked a little
pop fly that was easily caught before he reached
first. Captain Rankin himself was up next and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
managed to get to first on a swift grounder that
got past the shortstop. But he died on second, for
the next man up fanned. No runs for the Stars.</p>

<p>The Resolutes were jubilant, thinking this
augured well for them, but they looked a little
blank when Joe retired their first two men hitless.
For Joe had started off in good form. With the
first ball he delivered he knew that he was master
of the horsehide&mdash;at least for a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But oh! I hope I don&rsquo;t slump!&rdquo; and he almost
found himself praying that such a thing
would not happen.</p>

<p>He was in an agony of fear when he heard the
crack of the bat on the ball when the third man
came up. The spheroid went shooting off in
centre field, but by a magnificent stop Percy Parnell
gathered it in and the side was retired runless.
Things were not so bad for the Stars.</p>

<p>For the next two innings neither side got a run,
though there were some scattered hits. Again
was there talk of a pitchers&rsquo; battle, though in the
strict sense of the word this was not so, as both
Joe and Hen Littell were hit occasionally, and for
what would have been runs only for the efficient
fielding on both sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See if we can&rsquo;t do something this inning!&rdquo;
pleaded Rankin when his side came up in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
half of the fourth. The lads all tried hard and
Joe knocked a pretty one that was muffed by the
second baseman. However, he quickly picked it
up and hurled it to first. Joe got there about the
same time as the ball did, and to many he seemed
safe, but he was called out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, that&rsquo;s rotten!&rdquo; cried Tom Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it go!&rdquo; said Darrell sharply, and Tom
subsided.</p>

<p>The Stars got another goose egg&mdash;four straight&mdash;and
in their half of the fourth the Resolutes got
their first run. The crowd went wild and Joe
found himself clenching his hands, for the run
came in because he had given a man his base on
balls. The runner had successively stolen second
and third, and went home on a nice fly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m not going to slump!&rdquo; thought Joe
and there was a lump in his throat. For an instant
he found himself thinking of his father&rsquo;s
troubles, and then he firmly dismissed them from
his mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to pitch!&rdquo; he told himself
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got him going!&rdquo; chanted the Resolute
&ldquo;rooters.&rdquo; Joe shut his teeth grimly and struck
out the next man. Then he nipped the runner
stealing second and threw him out with lightning
speed. That somewhat silenced the jubilant cries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and when Joe managed to retire one of the Resolute&rsquo;s
heaviest hitters without even a bunt a big
crowd rose up and cheered him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re only one ahead,&rdquo; said Rankin as his
lads came in to bat. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s double it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And double it they did, the Star boys playing
like mad and getting enough hits off Littell to
make two runs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to wallop &rsquo;em!&rdquo; sang some
one in the visiting crowd and the song composed
for the occasion was rendered with vim.</p>

<p>Desperately as the Resolutes tried in their half
of the fifth to catch up to their rivals, they could
not do it. Joe was at his best and in that half
inning did not allow a hit. He had almost perfect
control, and his speed was good. Only once
or twice did he pitch at all wild and then it did no
harm as there was no one on base.</p>

<p>The sixth inning saw a run chalked up for each
team, making the score three to two in favor of
the Stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if we can only keep this up!&rdquo; exclaimed
Darrell, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have them. Can you do it, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so&mdash;yes, I can!&rdquo; he said with conviction.</p>

<p>Then came the lucky seventh, in which the Stars
pounded out three runs, setting the big crowd wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
with joy, and casting corresponding gloom over the
cohorts of the Resolutes. The Stars now had six
runs and their rivals were desperate. They even
adopted unfair tactics, and several decisions of the
umpire were manifestly in their favor. The crowd
hooted and yelled, but the young fellow who was
calling strikes and balls held to his opinion, and the
Resolutes closed their half of the seventh with two
runs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six to four in our favor,&rdquo; murmured the Stars&rsquo;
manager. &ldquo;If we can only keep this lead the
game is ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That word &lsquo;if&rsquo; is a big one for only two
letters,&rdquo; spoke Captain Rankin grimly. &ldquo;But
maybe we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither side scored in the eighth and then came
the final trial of the Stars unless there should be a
tie, which would necessitate ten innings.</p>

<p>Joe was to the bat in this inning, and oh! how
hard he tried for a run! He knocked a two
bagger and stole third. There was one out when
Bart Ferguson came up, and Bart was a heavy
hitter. But somehow he did not make good this
time. He managed to connect with the ball, however,
and as soon as Joe heard the crack he started
for home.</p>

<p>But there was brilliant playing on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the Resolutes. With a quick throw to home the
shortstop nipped Joe at the plate, and then the
catcher, hurling the ball to first, got the horsehide
into the baseman&rsquo;s hands before Bart arrived. It
was a pretty double play and retired the Stars with
a goose egg.</p>

<p>Still they had a lead of two runs and they might
be able to hold their rivals down. It was a critical
point in the game. As Joe took his place and faced
the batter he felt his heart wildly throbbing. He
knew he must hold himself well in hand or he
would go to pieces. The crowd of Resolute sympathizers
was hooting and yelling at him. Darrell
saw how things might go and ran out to the pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold hard!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Just take it
easy. Pitch a few balls to Bart and your nerve
will come back. We&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we will!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. The delivery
of a few balls, while the batter stepped away from
the plate, showed Joe that he still had his speed
and control. He was going to be wary what kind
of curves he delivered.</p>

<p>He struck out the first man up with an ease
that at first caused him wild elation, and then he
calmed himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two more,&rdquo; he reasoned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to get two more&mdash;two more.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<p>He was almost in despair when he was hit for a
two bagger by the next player, and he was in a
nervous perspiration about the man stealing to
third. Then Darrell signalled him to play for
the batter, and Joe did, getting him out with an
easy fly.</p>

<p>Then there was a mix-up when the next man hit,
and by an error of the left fielder the man on
second, who had stolen to third, went home with a
run, while the man who had brought him in got to
the last bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; yelled the crowd. &ldquo;Now
one more to make it a tie and another to win!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady, boys! Steady!&rdquo; called Darrell, as he
saw his team on the verge of a breakdown. &ldquo;We
can beat &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were now two out, one run was in, a man
was on third and a heavy batter was up&mdash;one of
the best of the Resolutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swat it, Armstrong! Swat it!&rdquo; cried the
crowd, and the big left fielder smiled confidently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ball one!&rdquo; cried the umpire, after Joe&rsquo;s first
delivery.</p>

<p>There was a gasp of protest from Bart behind
the plate, for the sphere had come over cleanly.
Darrell signalled to the catcher to make no protest.
Joe felt a wave of anger, but he endeavored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to keep cool. But when the second ball was called
on him he wanted to run up and thrash the umpire.
The latter was grinning derisively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a strike!&rdquo; cried Joe, in desperation
and he was gratified when Armstrong struck at it
and missed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you call that a ball?&rdquo; asked Bart
of the umpire. The latter did not answer.</p>

<p>Another ball was called and then a strike. Now
came the supreme moment. Two men out, a man
on third waiting to rush in with the tieing run, a
heavy hitter at bat and three balls and two strikes
called on him. No wonder Joe&rsquo;s hand trembled a
little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy, old man!&rdquo; called Darrell to him.
&ldquo;You can make him fan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe thought rapidly. He had studied the batter
and he thought that by delivering a swift in-shoot
he could fool Armstrong. It was his last chance,
for another ball meant that the batter would walk,
and there was even a better stick-man to follow.</p>

<p>Joe wound up, and sent in a swift one. His
heart was fluttering, he could hardly see, there was
a roaring in his ears. And then he dimly saw Armstrong
strike at the ball desperately. Almost at
the same moment Joe knew he would miss it.</p>

<p>The ball landed in the centre of Bart&rsquo;s big glove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
with a resounding whack. He held it exactly
where he had caught it. Joe had delivered the
winning throw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike three&mdash;batter&rsquo;s out!&rdquo; howled the umpire,
and then his voice was drowned in a yell of
joy from the sympathizers of the Stars.</p>

<p>For their team had won! The Resolutes were
retired with but one run in the ninth and the final
score was five to six in favor of our friends. They
had beaten their old rivals on their own grounds
and they had won the county championship!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great work, old man! Great!&rdquo; yelled Darrell
in Joe&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;You saved the day for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe modestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Baseball Joe!&rdquo; yelled Tom
Davis, and how those cheers did ring out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the Stars&mdash;they beat us fair
and square!&rdquo; called Captain Littell, and this was
quite a different ending than that which had
marked the previous game.</p>

<p>Some wanted to carry Joe around on their
shoulders but he slipped away, and got off his uniform.
Soon the team was on its way back to
Riverside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to be in a bigger team,&rdquo; Darrell
told Joe. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the making of a great
pitcher in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to stick around here for
a while yet,&rdquo; replied our hero, as he thought of
the fallen finances of his father. Never in all his
life had he so longed for the chance to go to boarding
school, and thence to college. But he knew it
could not be, chiefly through the treachery of Benjamin
and Holdney. Joe felt a wave of resentment
against them sweep over him, and his
thoughts were black and bitter.</p>

<p>Tom walked as far as Joe&rsquo;s street with him.
He had a silent sympathy that spoke more than
mere words could have done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; he said softly as they parted. &ldquo;It
was a great game, Joe, and I&rsquo;m almost glad you&rsquo;ve
got to stay with the Stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, did you win?&rdquo; asked his mother, as Joe
entered the house&mdash;entered it more listlessly than
winning a big game would seem to warrant. &ldquo;Did
you beat the Resolutes, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we did&mdash;why, mother, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
cried the young pitcher, for there was a look
of joy and happiness on her face, a look entirely
different than when he had left her after the bad
news. &ldquo;Has anything&mdash;anything good happened?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;there has. I just had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
another telegram from your father. Everything is
all right. He gets back his patents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Joe, as if unable to believe the
news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I tell you yes!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Matson,
and there was joy in her voice. &ldquo;At first your
father believed that all was lost, just as he wired
us. Then, most unexpectedly he tells me, they
were able to obtain some evidence from outside
parties which they had long tried for in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems that a witness for Mr. Benjamin and
his side, on whom they very much depended, deserted
them, and went over to your father and his
lawyer, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray for that witness, whoever he was!&rdquo;
cried Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; begged Clara, &ldquo;and let mother
tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to tell,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Matson.
&ldquo;With the unexpected evidence of this witness
your father&rsquo;s lawyer won the case, almost
at the last moment. In fact your father had given
up, and was about ready to leave the court when
the man sent in word that he would testify for
them. That was after your father sent the telegram
that came just before you went off to the
game, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; cried Clara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s your turn to be quiet and listen,&rdquo;
admonished Joe, with a smile at his sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have about finished,&rdquo; went on their mother.
&ldquo;The judge decided in your father&rsquo;s favor, and
he doesn&rsquo;t even have to share the profits of the invention
with the harvester company or with Mr.
Rufus Holdney, as he at one time thought he
would, for they have violated their contract. So
we won&rsquo;t be poor, after all, children. Aren&rsquo;t you
glad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; exploded Joe, throwing his arms
around his mother&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we won&rsquo;t have to leave this nice house,&rdquo;
added Clara, looking around the comfortable
abode.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I can go to boarding school&mdash;and pitch
on the school nine; can&rsquo;t I mother?&rdquo; cried Joe,
throwing his arms around her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I suppose so,&rdquo; she answered, with
half a sigh. &ldquo;But I do wish you&rsquo;d do something
else besides play baseball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something else besides baseball, mother!
Why, there&rsquo;s nothing to be compared to it. Hurray!
I&rsquo;m going to boarding school! I&rsquo;m going to
boarding school!&rdquo; and Joe, catching Clara around
the waist, waltzed her around the room. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
caught his mother on his other arm&mdash;the arm that
won the victory for the Stars that day&mdash;and her,
too, he whirled about until she cried for mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but this is great!&rdquo; Joe cried when he
stopped for breath. &ldquo;Simply great! I must go
and tell Tom. Maybe he can go to boarding
school with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And whether Tom did or not, and what were
our hero&rsquo;s further fortunes on the diamond, will be
related in the next volume, to be called: &ldquo;Baseball
Joe on the School Nine; or, Pitching for the Blue
Banner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an impromptu feast that night for
the victorious Silver Stars and Joe was the hero
of the occasion. He was toasted again and again,
and called upon to make some remarks, which he
did in great confusion. But his chums thought it
the best speech they had ever heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Baseball Joe!&rdquo; called Tom
Davis, and the room rang with them, while Joe
tried to hide his blushes by drinking glass after
glass of lemonade.</p>

<p>And now, for a time, we will take leave of him,
crying as his chums did after the great victory on
the diamond: &ldquo;Hurrah for Baseball Joe!&rdquo;</p>

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
